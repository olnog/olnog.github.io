		Sorry, guys. I had to end it because I just don't have the money for the droplet. I haven't had income since March 2020. It was a good experience and I appreciated everyone of you that played. It meant the world to me to have people -actually- playing my game. Maybe again some day. If you're interested in that, check my <a href='https://discord.gg/CjETTDYKdU'> discord</a>.

        My Purpose
      </h1>
      <div class=" mb-3 mt-3 ms-1 me-1">
        I aspire to create a self-sustaining, autonomous facility that can house multiple people.
      </div><div class=" mt-3 ms-1 me-1">
        On a more universal scale, I hope to create an organization,
which I am tenatively calling Stewards, whose express mission is
creating a post-scarcity future by taking on the responsibility of
providing for humanity.
