        Meta & Abortion : Choosing A Side In The Culture War
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        I've been a Facebook user since the beginning. I didn't originally use
        my real name. Growing on the Internet, I learned very quickly and emphatically:
        <span style='font-weight:bold;'>you do not use your real name.</span>
        But eventually, I got tired of having to explain who I was to every
        person I added so I just switched over. I think that's when The Internet,
        as a cultural phenomenon, truly went mainstream.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        Well, that's done with. At the beginning of this month, I deactivated
        Facebook, Instagram, and I'll have to make new accounts for all the
        accounts that are tied to my original Facebook. I'm still on Messenger
        just to see who needs to contact me so I can pass of the appropriate contact info
        but I'll be gone soon. (Technically, I did have to rejoin Instagram
        because I was trying to keep up with the recent goings-on for my
        high school reunion that just happened. But I'm off now.)
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        For anyone not paying attention to what's going on in America, the general
        consensus seems to be that we're headed towards another Civil War. Americans
        are constantly speculating how it'll play it out, but what most don't
        realize is that <span style='font-weight:bold;'>it's already here</span>.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        We're in a Cold Civil War, because we're already in a fucking culture
        war. Everything is political. Everything is politicized. Everything is
        partisan. And you can tell this, because you have to make your politics
        explicit in order to effectively communicate in text your underlying point.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        For example, with no context, maybe you read the previous paragraph completely
        neutral with no tone, and that's appropriate. Alternatively, if you're
        like me, you, maybe, read that from a 'centrist' POV. An exasperated plea for
        political civility and reconciliation. It's a very common view to take.
        That's not mine. Fuck civility. Fuck reconciliation.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        The culture war was conceived and is perpetuated by conservatives because
        they refuse to participate in contemporary American culture. Rather than meeting
        the average American where they lived, they've bunkered down and demanded
        the average American come to them instead. "You want me to wear a mask?
        Masks aren't a tool of public health. They are an instrument of
        oppression designed to take my freedoms away!"
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        And now they've criminalized abortion. For those of you that don't know me,
        there are two topics that reign supreme in American political theater:
        abortion and fighting white supremacy. White supremacy is, singlehandedly,
        the greatest scourge that American culture has ever faced, and abortion
        is a fundamental human right that should never be curtailed under any
        circumstances.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        The re-criminalization of abortion in America is the biggest L
        The Democratic Party has taken in modern American history and signals
        the fascistic ascendancy of the alt-right in America. The reason for that
        is that they did this <span style='font-weight:bold;'> while
        Democrats were in power</span>. Now you can say that it's because it
        happened in the Supreme Court and there was nothing Democrats could
        have done to prevent it. <span style='font-weight:bold;'> I don't give a shit.</span>
       <span style='text-decoration:underline;'>There is no circumstance in
         which this should have been allowed to happen.</span>
     </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
       So where does Facebook / Meta come in?
     </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
       Well, recently, Meta has been in the news because law enforcement
       officials were able to build a case against a teenager who aborted a
       pregancy from Messenger logs they received from Meta. And you know what?
       That's within the real of reason. We live in shitty times and Metas has to
       obey the rule of law and comply with subpoenas.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        Recently though, they've restricted a Facebook post directing people
        towards abortion pills.
        <a href='https://www.engadget.com/meta-restricted-planned-parenthood-post-195009632.html'>
          They're claiming this was an error on their part.</a> But this has
          been going on for
          <a href='https://www.wired.com/story/meta-abortion-content-restriction/'>quite a while.</a>
          This, coupled with their
          <a href='https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/19/23131714/meta-ban-abortion-discussion-at-work-facebook-workplace-roe-v-wade'>company policy on employees discussing abortion</a>
          is a bridge too far.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        One of the first things I did when logging onto the computer every day
        was checking Facebook. It wasn't always that meaningful, but it was a
        habit. I don't really miss it though. Anyone who's anyone knows me
        personally and I don't need Facebook for that. Instagram? Not really
        a big pictures guy and its usage has been completely supplanted by Tik
        Tok. Though, ironically, my Tik Tok was formerly tied to my Facebook
        account and starting a new one has been a bit of a journey because the
        algo doesn't have two years worth of data to know what I like anymore.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        The only real effect from quitting Meta is its messaging service, because
        the only other viable alternative that people I know use is WhatsApp,
        which is also a Meta service. But SMS isn't horrible.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-c'>
        Facebook didn't really originate social media, not even as part of the
        culture, which was more MySpace than anything. But there were some pretty
        good times and it was fun while it lasted. Maybe I'll come back some day.
        But that's not likely.

        Escaping Poverty Through Technology: A Cyberpunk Adventure
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        This will be an on-going post.  (at least until I escape poverty)
        Poverty is defined in America as any individual making, I believe,
        less that $1,300 a month. I live off far less than that. Less than $500.
        This is supplemented with EBT and MedicAid, which I am both grateful
        and <span style='font-weight:bold;'>entitled</span> to.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        I actually, at one point,
        <span style='font-weight:bold;'>aspired</span> to live in poverty. Ya see,
        I worked a dead end job that paid relatively well given the circumstances
        and while I wasn't in poverty, there was no forward momentum. No way to make
        more and more importantly, no way to spend less. I lived in a place
        where $1,000 was the -minimum- you could spend for an apartment and
        while I was simply renting a room, I probably wouldn't be able to find
        something for less than $500.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        In hindsight, I could have taken that next step and delved into van
        living, but that would have created its own problems: Higher MPG.
        Having to find a place to park every night to sleep. Relative sleep
        insecurity. (being rousted in the middle of the night by police or
        just being more easily subjected to loud noises in the area). This isn't
        even covering the drop in quality of life I'd have to take by
        living in a vehicle. (showers, toilets, running water, refrigeration,
        electricity, heating)
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        I couldn't move anywhere else cheaper though. I was already
        living in the cheapest area possible because I was tied to my job. I could
        have quit and gone anywhere else in the country but I also knew that I wouldn't be
        able to find a job like the one I had that paid as well as it did and
        required so little work.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        The dream was to live, preferably, from some income over the Internet and
        live in a dirt cheap area in an almost rustic fashion. Even living
        in a van wouldn't be so bad if I didn't have to make myself presentable
        for IRL meetings and I owned the land I lived on.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        Part of that dream came to fruition in 2017. I lost my job. I was in poverty.
        <span style='font-weight:bold;'> And I did it really, really poorly.</span>
        Leading up to my firing, I knew it was going to happen eventually so
        I saved my money as frugally as possible. That, coupled with vacation
        and sick time I never used and unemployment eventually netted me
        about $12k. So that was, at least, a positive.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        I was so new to poverty I didn't know any better. I signed up to my old
        health insurance on a cash basis and was spending $600 per month instead
        of just getting MedicAid immediately. I also didn't
        sign up for EBT immediately. Within 6 months, most of it was pretty much gone.
        By then I signed up for EBT and MedicAid, so at least that was a plus. And
        the one thing I did right was moved almost as soon as I lost my job so I was paying
        a lot less in rent.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        But I was only working sporadically because it was pretty much impossible
        to find a job in that area. I applied to 200+ jobs and only got
        call backs from less than 10. So I moved to Arizona.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        Arizona was okay. I didn't like it that much. I lost EBT and MedicAid but I got a job almost
        immediately. I had to quit it though because my living situation changed
        and I was commuting an hour and half each way to work. I was working
        more than I was before but still not enough. Then I finally got a job I liked: Shake Shack.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        Shake Shack opened in Gilbert, AZ in December of 2019. I had a job there as a
        fry cook. It was great. I loved it. I honestly wished I still worked there. But then COVID hit.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        March 2020, I took a leave to see how COVID would play out and it never
        stopped. I got unemployment, thankfully, and I actually got such a crazy
        high amount that I was able to save another $12k. This time it lasted though.
        More than 2 years.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        That's where we find me now. <span class='font-weight: bold;'>September
        2022</span>. I barely left the house
        from March 2020 to April 2021 then again from July 2021 til now. It seems
        mostly safe now, but I'm mainly in the house because of poverty and COVID, while
        still a concern, is more secondary at this time.
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-b'>
        In mythology, where does the hero go when faced with adversity? Me?
        I got no fucking idea,
        but considering how much I loved cyberpunk, I'm genuinely hoping that
        technology will be the answer. We'll see how it goes. More updated to come.

      </div><div id='2022-09-14-a' class='post-header'>
        My Website (Or Writing As Eloquently As Possible Into The Void)
      </div><div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-a'>
        I really struggled to come up with something to put on here. It made me
        question: why do I even have a website? Ya see, this current website
        (https://internetwebsite.cyou/) is replacing my former website. I'm currently mired in extreme First World poverty
        and just can't justify spending $15 a year (or whatever it is) for a .com
        when I can spend $4 a year for a .cyou.
      </div> <div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-a'>
        Now I could just copy and paste the old site, but the old site was based
        around my username at the time. And now that that website is kaput,
        eventually, so will that username.
      </div> <div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-a'>
        A big reason why I have a website is I hope someone will
        <a  href="mailto:therealolnog@gmail.com?subject=Hiring Inquiry">hire me</a>.
        So I initally sat down and tried to think about how to make this a compelling
        resume, but, honestly, my skills and experience just aren't that compelling. I've done
        some stuff, but a lot of it was based on LAMP stack and now I can't
        afford the hosting costs of a LAMP server. This is hosted off of Github
        for free so now I'm mostly relegated to static pages.
      </div> <div class='post-body invisible 2022-09-14-a'>
        Now I could have made it a more speculative thing. Like a sort of roadmap
        of where I want my skills and experiences, but how to practically do that
        in an aesthetically pleasing way escaped me, so I figured: fuck it.
        I'll just put stuff on this site and do it as I go. Like a living,
        breathing document.
