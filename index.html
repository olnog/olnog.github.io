      <b>poor mans wikipedia: </b> working on this page made me think of this idea I had a while back of a 'poor man's wikipedia' which is probably the shittiest elevator pitch. the idea is that ANYTHING could be an entry and it'd be less like a definitive summary or whatever and just a database of entries. like this right now, what I'm talking about would reference wikipedia but it would also reference whatever the main topic is. That's probably a bad example, but you'd be able to tag every entry with its relevant references.

      <b>Blackberry movie:</b> The weird thing about being old and living through time periods depicted in media is seeing the weird anachronisms that are depicted. In 2003, I can imagine that someone was still listening to a cassette tape but not a walkman.  I was listening to tapes in 2008 or 2009 but only because my car had a tape player and I didn't have money to replace it or buy a tape adapter. The idea that a techie would still be listening to tapes seems pretty unlikely.  (I just realized this character is wearing an 80s handband in 2008, so maybe it's not so crazy.)

      <b>T-Mobile Sidekick:</b> Watching this movie reminded me of that brief period of time when the Sidekick was so awesome. I remember seeing Paris Hilton use it and thought it was so cool. Blackberry was for business professionals and was probably out of my league. I got the Sidekick 3. I was a little disappointed though. It didn't have the smartphone functionality that I dreamed of. At that point, we were still in the nascent phones-aren't-quite-computers-yet stage. It was cool af to type on that though. I remember just literally sitting in a courtyard texting random people, just because I could.
