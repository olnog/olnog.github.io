			On July 4, 2022, I started taking one day out of the week to live a more Stewardship-oriented life. This is my written record of that.
		</div><div style='font-weight:bold;'>
			July 4, 20222 Monday	
		</div><div>
			The day that I started. It's hard for me to describe the motivation for this, but I'll try. I read a really great tweet from Nassim Taleb. It was a link to a Medium article that itself was an excerpted chapter from his book: Skin In The Game. The chapter in question posits the utility of cultural intolerance and how larger society must adapt to that group's intolerance as a reaction. (Intolerance may be an indelicate word but I think it's relatively accurate.) The example he gives is: within the Jewish population, it's very important that dairy and meat be Kosher. On nearly every dairy and meat product in America there is an inconspicuous little symbol to indicate that it is Kosher. Anti-semitism considerations aside, why would dairy and meat producers make do this when Jewish people make up less than 3% of the population? Because -not- doing it is a guaranteed loss and it doesn't take that much effort to comply.

			Liberals, such as myself, place a lot of unquestioned value in tolerance. Even conservatives will use the term 'the tolerant left' to ridicule liberals when they object to some kind of 'cancelling'. 
		</div><div>
			The philosophy behind Stewardship started a while ago, but when I read that excerpt, I tried to think of core cultural values from Stewardship that could be encapsulated in a shield of intolerance. What aspects of Stewardship are so important that nothing less could ever be accepted? 
		</div><div>
			There are more important aspects of Stewardship, (namely servicing a community) but one very important aspect is this:
		</div><div>
			The Steward creates and should therefore strive to only consume products of their own creation. If they are unable to, the consumption or utilization of an object or objects created by another Steward (preferably one close in their lineage) shall suffice. The only exception to this rule is that Stewards may use tools from any creator but they should strive even in this situation to make their own tools.
		</div><div>
			It's a fundamental precept. It's what the entire foundation of Stewardship is built on and theoretically, what separates us from more casual philathropic work. 
		</div><div>
			So, for one day out of the week, I will go out of my way to avoid using or consuming products or things that are not created by me. This is difficult. I am a consumer in a consumer-driven society. Consumption is everything. But it's an endeavor I think will help me get started in the right mindset for Stewardship. 

		</div><div>
			My day starts some time after noon time when I wake up, but I wanted it to be clearly on Monday, so I started it at midnight July 4, 2022, Monday. A different kind of independence. 
		</div><div>
			I had to make a lot of exceptions. Some of them are obvious: food, water, medicine, clothing, sewage, because I don't have a way of creating those immediately from the beginning. Another couple exceptions I made were: electric lighting, refrigeration, cooking, running water, and soap. Refrigeration, cooking, running water and soap are all basic because they're all foundations of modern society. Technically, I probably could get by without refrigeration, and I'm going to try to figure out how, eventually. Cooking is kind of necessary, because I eat 3 cups of beans per day for its fiber content, but I'm still going to try to create a more integrated system for that as well. Electric lights are just a guilty pleasure, mainly because I will be awake from dusk to about 6am and it would be really unpleasant if I had to be in the dark and unable to read during tha time. 
		</div><div>
			It gets very hot where I live, because I'm in the desert. But, for now, I won't be allowing air conditioning. Though, I am renting a room, so I won't always have control over that because I have to consider the people I live with.

		</div><div>
			I am planning on creating these basic necessities in the future. Making my own clothes, making my own shoes, making my own bedding, my own food, harvesting rainwater and purifying it,  etc. But this is an inaugaural test to see what I need.
		</div><div>
			Now some people might be looking on this at an abstract level and question what I'm actually accomplishing considering how much I do have, but I guess I should say what I won't have access to. Video games, Internet, computing, television, most forms of music. This is what 90% of my life is right now and I'm taking that away. I am allowing the ability to receive phone calls just out of courtesy to my Mom and to record videos on my phone to document what's happening, but that's it. No Internet access. I'm also allowing paper and pen just to be able to write stuff down and because I have almost too much paper that I need to work towards getting rid of. Most of my entertainment will be books that I've been meaning to read. I am planning, eventually, to allow a Raspberry PI, because I should go through my small collection of books pretty quickly and digital books are more accessible and cheaper. I would prefer that Raspberry PI to be run off solar but I probably won't have enough money to do that, but I'll allow it if I can get Linux From Scratch running on it. (Thankfully, someone's already doing that project.)
		</div><div>
			I thought about simplifying the cooking prcoess down by using a barbeque instead of a stove, microwave or oven, but I feel like that's not really helping in terms of being able to create that, because I'd still be depedent on commercial charcoal as a fuel source. Plus, I'm not making the barbeque. Though, I could do a campfire situation, but still would be dependent on commercial charcoal or commercial firewood.

		</div><div>
			I guess it's important to talk about what I'm NOT trying to do. It's not important that I be able to create a light bult from its constituent elemental parts, like blowing the glass, creating the filament, and all that. That is the ideal, but it's not that important. What's most important is that I understand the underlying processes behind every system that I am involved in. For example, I thought about creating my own operating system, but at the end of the day, I'm most likely going to make it work with Linux anyways, so why bother? There's no point in reinventing the wheel, when the wheel is going to do the same thing as any other wheel. Maybe some future generation of Stewards will feel it's necessary to physically fabricate CPUs, but it's probably not going to be me.
		</div><div>
			When I started, I genuinely didn't think I was going to be able to do it for the whole 24 hours. I went without power a couple weeks before this and it was so annoying and frustrating, and that was during the day.
		</div><div>
			As soon as I started, I realized without electricity, I wouldn't be able to know what time it is. Thankfully, I still had my grandfather's pocket watch, so I used that. It wasn't completely reliable. At one point, around 6pm or so, it just stopped working. I wound it up but it stopped again shortly after. I had to wind it all the way and it finally continued working. I can't rely on that entirely, so I'll be working on a sun dial and a water clock.
		</div><div>
			I made another exception for thermometers. I get anxiety when I feel really hot and I don't know why. I start to think I might be sick and in this time of covid, I wonder if I might have caught it. Plus, given that I live in the desert, I think it would be nice to know how hot it's going to be at a given time. It didn't get too hot that day. I think it peaked at 88 degrees. For some reason, I didn't really find the heat intolerable until around 8pm. I don't know why. I don't think it was the humidity. I woke up around 2pm and it was at 86, so it didn't even really change that much. Maybe it was just being in 80+ degree temperatures for an extended period of time.
		</div><div>
			I had a bag of old clothes that I had hoped to eventually repurpose into something else. So when this started, I went through it to figure out what I could turn it into. The one rule I had was that I couldn't turn old underwear into new underwear or old shirts into new shirts. It had to be recycled into something new. Unfortuantely, nothing really seemed adequate for what I needed to make, so I decided to order some fabric to make clothes instead. 
		</div><div>
			I made another exception: using the washing machine. In this case though, I'm not using the washing machine for this day, I'm using it to be able to clear off some blankets from my bed. Either way, it's going to go in the washing machine, so it makes no difference if I throw it in now or later. You could make an argument that I'm cheating, but there's almost no situation in which I'm going to wash blankets by hand when another option is available.  
		</div><div>
			Another exception that I'm actually lowkey ashamed of: soda. There's no actual justification for this other than my addiction. This day would be so much more unpleasant if I couldn't drink soda. I might start drinking it unrefrigerated if I reach a point in the process where that's the the only refrigerated item I'm consuming. I'd like to be able to create my own but I drink diet soda so that's a little bit more tricky. 
		</div><div>
			One insight I had during this test run was that if I had a job, this would make things very difficult. Because I have to withdraw almost entirely from society in order to do this. (I am planning on adding other restrictions like not talking to non-Stewards when that becomes viable.) When I eventually get one, I'll have to just change it to once a week, or change the day to accomodate my work, but Monday will probably always be the restrictive intolerance day. Then I realized this isn't really intended for lay people. Stewardship has always been intended as a Monastic order. 
		</div><div>
			For the most part, it wasn't really that difficult, but once it reached around 10pm, I was really looking forward to midnight. July 4th wasn't ideal, because I had to have the window open but people kept setting off fireworks for the holiday. I spent most of my day reading and was able to finish off two books. 
		</div><div>
			The main project I worked on that day and afterwards was making some sandals. The specific type is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paduka'>paduka</a> I had some particle board, a dowel and some scrap I was able to make into it. Unfortuantely, it doesn't have the heel and toe like the one in the link. It's just flat. I also didn't shape it like a foot because I figured it wasn't important for testing. I'm writing this entry a few days after July 4th, and I just finished the sandals a couple days ago. They aren't great. They're barely functional. It's not pleasant walking on pieces of wood, obviously. But I'm concerned that I might injure myself by the particle board breaking in half or the dowel breaking and I'm going to stab myself in the foot. So, I'll probably use it only this Monday, but I'm going to try to make a new pair of sandals from rope.
		</div><div>
			One exception I never noticed until after I had already done it was tissues. I'm making an exception for toilet paper, because the current alternative is much worse, but with tissues it's relatively trivial to make some hankies. So that's another project. 
		</div><div>
			One assumption that I made when starting this project is that I would not be able to create my own shelter in order to do this. While doing the test run though, I was in the garage, enjoying a cross breeze between the back door and front door. And I thought, it'd be nice if I could be in a place where it was possible to feel a breeze from all directions. Then I realized all I need is a tent of some kind. This isn't impossible, but there are a LOT of ants in both yards. Just when I was in the garage, I had to keep constant watch of the ants crawling in to make sure they don't bite me. And there's really no great place to set it up in the backyard. If I do set up a tent, I will also have to create a special structure to avoid the ants as well.
		</div><div>
			All in all, I think it was a good experience but there were a few different thing I need to make sure I've already done beforehand next time: cover all clocks, clean dishes in the dishwasher, and have my beans already cooked.
