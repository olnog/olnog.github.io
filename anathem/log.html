    <h3>4391-640 [September 4, 2024]</h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">The Discipline / Halal Media: </span> I can't believe this will be the third day I've maintained The Discipline. (mostly - There was that period I was working on my car and didn't want to write down -everything- I was putting on as safety gear.) One thing I noticed from yesterday though is that productivity (or an aspect of that) needs to be a part of it, because I spent most of yesterday just consuming old media. With that, I'm becoming less and less comfortable with the idea of it being 10 cycles ago. I don't want to be actively counting the clock every day, being like, "oh, what historical media can I consume today?" I'm wondering if it's better to just to go to the nearest 0 and -then- go back ten cycles. So I'd go back to the beginning of 4390 and then go back to 4380. Maybe that's too far actually. Waiting every 30 years to consume media is the opposite end of that spectrum but 3, that's not bad and that will give even more emotional significance to a new cycle.
    </div><div>
        One thing I was thinking about is that once I've reached the bottom of downloading video from YouTube and Internet Archive, and I have to start buying it, isn't that just as bad as being a regular consumer? Aren't I just the equivalent of an antique collector except for media? I've been thinking about time management a lot in this regard and I think I need to set a limit, maybe just personally, for how much time I'm browsing for new media.
    </div><div>
        I had an idea about encouraging productivity today. On my papers, the one I use to keep track of interactions, what if I marked off in a different color, the things that I -could- do. Smething productive that I know that I could do.
    </div><div>
        Like any system that relies on self reporting, I understand the shortcomings but it's more the mindfulness of it than anything. Last night, before I went to bed, I just gave up entirely on time reporting, but that's more just being conscious of how I spend my time than anything. And, also, I've started to realize the things that I'm not keeping track of but should. It's important to not beat myself up about it while also remaining vigilant.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Metric Clock: </span>So I fixed the clock web page. It hasn't said the correct day since I made the original python code. I also added timers to the python app and both implementations I was hoping for. I wanted to add a straight timer that just starts from whenever you start the script (3.2 would be a timer for 3,200 metric seconds) and a timer that can start from a specified time (3.2@39 is a timer that presumes you start it at 39 and would do 3,200 metric seconds) I also changed how it calculates the time. It only calculates it every 1,000 metric seconds. Outside of that, it just increments the variables.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">: </span>    
    </div>
    <h3>4391-639 [September 3, 2024]  </h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">The Discipline / Holy Day: </span>From now on, I'll just refer to the act of keeping track of my interactions as The Discipline instead of Holy Days. It makes it slightly less grandiose. 
    </div><div>
        So I went outside to work on my car and I had originally planned to just put some rubber gloves on and include that as The Discipline for what I was doing. But I'm using some epoxy adhesive to secure my bumper back on and it recommended to clean whatever clothes you dirt with it 'professionally' so I figured I would put my overalls on and just log it as a lapse of Discipline while I did that.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Paper: </span>Dropped the first batch of paper and I think I'm all out of paper pulp. I could not for the life of me get a good dip. It was only after I blended the past few bad batches and poured it in that I was able to finish. 
    </div><div>
        I checked the batch after 6k. Probably could have went up to 7k or 8k. It was mostly dry but it tore a bit getting it off. Also, when I was adding the screen to this one last night, I just grabbed the first bit of screen I saw which wasn't enough to cover the entire frame so the two pieces overlap each other. I figured it would have some kind of effect but didn't know what.
    </div><div>
        I knew it would get in between the two layers but the real danger is the top layer of paper drying with that middle layer attached to it and having to tear it apart, so I'm going to put a new screen. I'm also going to make a new deckle entirely.
    </div><div>
        Now that I understand the role that the thickness plays, I've been wondering what to do with re-recycled paper. All of my batches of paper have been paper that I've shredded and blended, but what about that paper? I could maybe do one or two additional batches but I'm assuming there's a bottom and I think toilet paper would be a good avenue. THough, I'm not sure how I would make it sanitary for those purposes.        
    </div>
    <h3>4391-638 [September 2, 2024] (u14.6k [11:05] - 99.9k)</h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Holy Day Log: </span> I'm going to make the dates and time metric oriented now. I'm pretty comfortable with it and I've already done it in my personal notes and my interaction log, so why not?
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Holy Day: </span> The name "Holy Day" seems unnecessarily ostentation and pretentious. I really gotta come up with something better to denote these time periods. The Discipline? idk. So, today, I'm going to try to do a full day of this. I have a bunch of days off in a row and I've been wanting to spend more and more time engaged like this so we'll see how this goes. And, I think, specifically, because of how special this day is, I'll also be posting the other documents for today.
    </div><div>
        I think I've explained this previously but I have two pieces of paper where on the first one, I jot down notes for the day and recently started keeping track of how I'm spending my time. The second paper, I keep track of my 'Interactions' which are with things I have not personally produced (there are some exceptions), food, programs, and media. (Look up Halal Media regarding that.)
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Metric Clock: </span>I spent most of my early day setting up an alarm. I'm still having some formatting issues on the console that I'm not sure how to resolve but it works pretty well for what I intended. I might create timers later or save that for another day.
    </div><div>        
        <span class="category">Paper: </span>Last time, I made paper I believe I waited 2.5 hours for the paper to dry and it was still a little wet. It's more than 38 degree celsius outside right now and when I left it out for 3 hours this time to firm it up so it wouldn't tear, it went completely dry. I won't be using the little frame anymore because it tore, but I did make some progress in regards to the proper thickness of paper. I've always had this issue where the paper is just too thick. When I moved to a bigger frame, the paper got a little bit thinner but I just didn't understand how to control it as a skill when dipping the deckle-frame in the vat. Today was the first day I kinda figured out how to do it. I think now I need to start making deckles where the frame isn't a part of it. 
    </div><div>
        In the interest of centering myself towards a more metric-time based way of thinking, instead of doin X hours, I'll be checking the next paper after 10k instead of 12k.
    </div><div>
        So I checked it 10k after the last batch, it was still super dry and I think I didn't use enough this time because the margins were thin enough, the paper started to tear when I took it off the deckle-mold. The next batch I'll check in 6k instead.
    </div><div>
        6k after the last  batch. It wouldn't come off the deckle-mold. I kept tapping it over and over again and it started separating from the center but eventually it started to tear because the sides had already dried to the deckle-mold. So I took the mold off and the part I was hoping to keep is actually completely broke in half. So I attached the other half even though it's not an even surface and the pulp is pooling in the center, there's no mold in it at all. I'll check it in 3k and hopefully, it will have dried just enough to be together but not enough to tear apart.
    </div><div>
        Checked in 3k after last batch and it had either started to dry too much to the deckle or not enough. I'm going to go with the former and check back at 1k. It had dried to certain sections but there's a big enough section to maybe be useful. We'll see how that one turns out. I had a lot of trouble getting a good dip, so either the vagaries of the deckle are just letting it go square or I'm almost out of pulp. But it seems pretty cloudy so I think it's the former. Also, I really messed up. Some of my scrap wood is MDF and when I made this deckle, I used some MDF. (I think that's what it's called.) And MDF is HORRIBLE when it gets wet.
    </div><div>
        Yeah, so it wasn't dry enough. 1k, it tore completely apart. So next time I'll have to do 6k and hopefully get a better batch. If this doesn't work out, I might try attaching the screen to the upper and lower part of a frame and have it come out so that I can kinda fold the paper out instead of trying to tap it free.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Holy Day Interactions: </span> I make a dispensation for furniture, but something about a mattress bothered me. It didn't seem to fit the criteria of furniture while also seeming to fit the criteria. But I figured out a good metric. I don't include furniture like my desk and my computer chair because in order to use my computer, I need to be able to place the monitor somewhere and I need to be able to sit somewhere. Now I could stand to use my computer but I'd have to set my desk up to do that. I could set my stuff up on the ground but just seems so anti-ergonomic as to defeat its purpose. A mattress though? I can lay on the ground to sleep. I've done it before. It's not impossible or ergonomically impractical. So that's why it applies. 
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Halal Media: </span>So I was having a bit of trouble because I wanted a more accurate time period for media than 'before 1994'. When I did calculation, it was 10,000 days divided 365.25, which is 27.3 years ago. Way sooner than 1994, my original estimate, which I didn't understand. Then I looked at <a href='#4391-625'>the original entry</a>, and it talked about 10 cycles ago 'and the current year', which I thought was a weird thing to throw in, but I meant the current cycle. And if I minus the current days of this cycle -and then-  minus ten cycles, that gives me the number which is closer to 29. But how do I get a more specific date? For now, I just typed in the current number of days in the cycle plus 10,000 as a google search of "what date was it 10,638 days ago" and it gave me: July 18, 1995, which is perfect for my purposes.
    </div><div>
        So I'm watching a show from 1990 but it's clearly from a VHS recording from 1998. Is that considered acceptable? It comes with the commercials from that year so I'm not entirely sure.

    <h3>August 30, 2024 [4391-635] (9:05 [u6.3k] - 12:10 [u19.2k] ~3h / 12.9k</h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Notes: </span> Every time I do this, I have two sheets of paper. (more if the sheets are smaller) But one covers all of my interactions, food, programs, and media I use that day. The other is notes where I make sure to put the beginning and end times and any notes I might have during that period. Usually, that's questions, but last time it was just the beginning and end times, so I thought maybe it'd be better if I start documenting what I'm doing as well in terms of the time spent on things. Also, I've been wondering if there's any utility in posting those pages on here, because I do scan them but I just haven't bothered partly for privacy reasons and I figure no one cares any way.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Metric Clock: </span>I was really worried how much drift there would be after a few days of letting the program run. (I made a <a href='https://github.com/olnog/pyclock/tree/main'>github for it</a> if you're interested.) I was a little disappointed to find out it was initially off by 100, but there was something odd about how it was incrementing. Instead of incrementing by 1, it was incrementing by 10. There was a 9 at the end that just wasn't going up at all. Then I realized, I had probably just inputted a character accidentally and there was only a second drift between it and the web app, which is right on mark for me.
    </div><div>
        I was thinking about how I made a mistake with original calculation for the cycle-day and I realized I messed up again. To adjust for the Holocene Calendar, I multipled 11969 by 365.25 ( I know the actual number is 365.24 but I just did a little rounding up) and I just rounded down, ignoring whatever the decimals were afterwards. In hindsight, I should have just added those to the day tally.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Paper: </span>Turns out the larger piece of paper was pretty good in terms of overally thickness, better than the small piece was.  And that was always the issue with the small pieces, they were just too thick, they had no give like a regular piece of paper. If I folded it, I'm pretty sure it would just tear. I made another sheet of larger paper after work a few days ago and it came out mostly pretty good, except I guess I didn't wait long enough for it dry because it tore a little but when I took it out but still usable. 
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Towel: </span>So I had made a towel out of socks previously. I took a shower earlier and...it was not great. I thought the moisture wicking properties that are used for socks would translate well but they do not. It still got the job done at the end of the day but it just wasn't good. 
    
    </div>
    <h3>August 25, 2024 [4391-630] (12:44 [u21.78k] - 22:25 [u62.1k]) - ~10h / 62.1k <h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Paper: </span> After what feels like a long time without being productive, I finally start making paper again. I'm using whatever remanants from the previous batch are still in the vat and adding 100 grams of recycled paper, shredded and blended and 11 grams of dryer lint blended.
    </div><div>
        The first issue I ran into was just taking too long for it to dry before pulling it off the deckle mold. It's been at least an hour. The main reason why I want to take off before it dries is so I can press it better. This is creating a lot of problems for me. It felt like I was able to do this just fine with half of the last batch but I keep messing up lately. The paper just starts tearing off of the mold as I tap it to get it off. I'm going to wait just until it stops actively dripping then try taking it off.
    </div><div>
        I fell asleep. The paper isn't too horrible when it dries. It's just not the right thickness and texture. I thought both of them would be mostly dry. The small one was mostly dry but the large one I just created was still wet and I might be able to get something good out of it. I think the next step is to build a new deckle that's just frame, because my past two have been two frames with the screen sandwiched between it. I'll try stapling it onto there, see how that works.
    <div>
        <span class="category">Metric Time:</span> I messed up on the first iteration of the clock. I'm not sure what my original math was but 4,371,922 doesn't come back cleanly to the Holocene year of 11970. To give some context, I use the unix time function to find the number of seconds since 1970 but then for calculating the current, I need to figure out how many days have happened up to that point. But that original number is not accurate at all. It comes close to it if I divide by 365.24 but not sure what I was doing with that.
    </div><div>
        Another issue is that if I'm calculating for Unix Time I should have only gone up to 1969 not 1970. This changes the date from 4391-875 to 4391-630. Thankfully, the time stayed relatively the same.
    </div>   <div>
        <span class="category">Land: </span> I was thinking about the Divinity of Land and how that kind of creates the necessity of buying more and more land. And it made me think about maybe doing a statistical survey of the cheapest land both in terms of availability of plots to a local geographical area and the cost per acre. I have to see if I can get that kind of access MLS's.
    </div>
    
    <h3>August 21, 2024 [4391-871] (14:48 [u30.5k] - 23:33 [u69.9k]) - 39.4k / 9.45h</h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Metric Time: </span> After some deliberation, I think a better way to present the date through universal metric time is "[cycle]-[date]" with no commas. Also, I'm going to maybe work on a fancier version of the clock that displays just the time.
    </div><div>
        The fancier version was basically a screen saver that I had planned when there was no more imput on the page but I gave up on that and decided to create timers, alarms, conversions and make the time a LOT bigger on the screen.
    </div><div>
        Turns out there's an issue with the clock. The alarm should have gone off almost ten minutes ago but it was still six minutes away. I was waiting for 54k but still had 500 metric seconds left. So I refreshed the page. I was already at 55k. I'm assuming it's an issue with the page not being in focus and javascript skipping intervals. Though, this computer is pretty underpowered so it might be related to that. Maybe I could refresh the page every 1k metric seconds.
    </div><div>
        I'm kind of questioning the utility of Earth-based metric time. When would that ever be useful? I guess if you want the time of day to mean something consistently throughout a historical period. Like 0 is always solar noon, so that gives context as to what part of the day it is but for universal time you have to calculate the drift in order to figure that out. It's just universal metric time is soooo much simpler because there is no geographical context.
    </div><div>
        There's another thing I've been thinking about and that's shortening cycles down to just meaningful information. The year is 2024 but I take no qualms in shortening the current date down to 24/08/21. Why couldn't I do that with cycles? Because it just feels wrong to go from 4,391 to just 91. Maybe because it's a new system and I don't -know- what the other two numbers are. It's not an inherent part of my being. Part of my culture. Something that -everyone- know. I think when that happens is when metric time has truly become a thing.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Haram Media: </span> I was reading through the Divinity of Infrarstructure and it made me realize that maybe 10 cycles isn't enough time. It's pretty easy so I'm going to keep it for the near future because I want to encourage myself to continue, but if the idea is to encourage people to create their own and art is mostly a living cultural phenomenon then halal media is really only the media outside of living memory.
    </div><div>
        This means that if the oldest person ever was 122 years old then only media past that point is concsidered halal so 1902 and beyond. This is pretty ascetic in terms of music. It's mainly old ass shit like Scott Joplin. Movies are just as bad. I searched for about four movies released that year. Only found one and it was unwatchable. What if I do only half? 61 years.
    </div><div>
        1963 is a lot easier of a point. It's not quite as breezy as 1993 but it't not as bad as 1902. When I feel up to it, I will eventually migrate to this point as the new guideline for haram media. 
    </div><div>
        Actually, that's kind of an imperial time oriented view so let's do 20 cycles instead and that pins the year to beyond 1969, which is about the same result.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Productivity: </span> I don't think I was really all that productive today. I did quite a bit of work on the clock page and I'm proud. Though, the fact that it's running behind kind of puts things in a bad light. 
    </div><div>
        I had this idea for a productivity hack. Instead of To Do list, a Could Do list. A list where I write down things I -could- do. To Do's are obligations and responsbiliies. Could Do's are possibilities and I like that framing. I just felt off today though. I realized one impediment is having to go into the garage to work on stuff and not being able to work on it inside. 
    </div>
    <h3 id="4391-625">August 20, 2024 [c:4,391 d:870] (18:25 [u46k] - 22:20 [u62k]) </h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Negligence: </span>It's been too long since I've done this. Even if I don't accomplish anything, it's more important to put myself in this mindset and focus on a small aspect of it than it is to be 'productive'. Not engaging in this mindset is negligence.
    </div>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Metric Time: </span> I don't like the way metric time looks written as 5.5UK. UK is to readily identifiable as 'United Kingom' and I think "u:5.5k" is a slightly clearer way of putting things than the previous way. (Maybe...) 
    </div><div>
        ACtually, let's omit the : so let's just make "u5.5k", I think that'll be a more natural presentation.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Holy Day Protocol: </span> Now that I've started to keep track of what programs I use, there is a general guideline that I should always use the simplest version of something. (Though, to be fair, I'm using a pen now but that's just because I significantly prefer pens over pencils and have some crappys ones I could use up before I go back to pencils.) I'm making an exception for the program I use to write this. In an ideal world, I would just be using a text editor to write this. Maybe even something as spartan as a cli text editor. (vi) But for sake of ergonimics, readiability and usability, I decided to just use an IDE because git is integrated directly into it.
    </div><div>
        Also, today I've started to keep track of any media I might consume during this time period. Media is defined as anything fictional, music, or art in the general sense of the term. I'm allowing some media to be grandfathered in. Neal Stephenson's Anathem. (obviously) And I was thinking about historical media but I'm not really sure what date would be good. If the current cycle is 4,391, what about everything from cycle 4000 and beyond? Which begs the question: what year is that?
    </div><div>
        So that's super far. As I was writing the Javascript algorithm to calculate it back to regular years, I realized metric seconds doesn't really matter in this calculation. (It does for more accuracy.) But for the most part, a day is a day, so 391 cycles is just 391,000 days which is 1071 years ago. That's a lot further than what I had anticipated and I really don't want to be reading stuff that predates Shakespeare. So let's try 100 cycles: 273 years. 273 years is still further than I  would like. Lemme see what kind of reading material I'd have from Internet Archive.  Yeah, it's not great. It's not completely intolerable from a consumption standpoint but it's not ideal. So let's do 10 cycles but let's also include the current date as well. Ten cycles ago was roughly 29.8 years ago which would put it at 1994. Very, very doable. Almost too easy. The idea is to remove myself from the consumption of media and 1994 is three generations ago, so that's not too bad. Actually, let me look at my collection of media. Music, (because I'm old) I think will be a lot easier to find old stuff, but for TV shows and movies, let's see. 
    </div><div>
        I forgot that my external hard drive where I keep all my media isn't accessible on this computer so, yeah, we'll call it. All media from before ten cycles and I guess I gotta create an app to figure out it's our equivalent of haram. (Oh, wow, I forgot about video games. That's very interesting to me as a potential thing.) Though, this does put an interesting predicament in terms of data storage, because I think I have to seegment my data storage in terms of haram and halal. 
    </div><div>        
        <span class="category">Terminology: </span> I have couched things before this in terms of 'sin' as an appeal to give The Organization a religious or at the very least, a spiritual appeal. With this recent entry, I'm characterizing things as 'haram' and 'halal' which makes me feel anxious, but then I realize that this is just the inherent Islamaphobia of being an American in America so it will stay. Though, I wonder in which case the terms 'sin' and 'haram/halal' would be appropriate, because they are not interchangeable. For the purposes of this document, I will be characterizing inherent characteristics of people and behavior (though not necessarily behavior of people) as sin and the inherent characteristic of things that are not people as 'haram' and 'halal'. I don't know if this is on par for the actual usage of these terms within their respective relgions but it feels natural to me.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">The Divinity of Infrastructure: </span> This is kind of a wild idea but I was thinking about how I don't keep track of the fact that I'm in a house I didn't build, typing on a desk I didn't build, etc. And I was thinking about that inevitable moment when I will build my own house and desk and I'll have to keep track of those kinds of things, but then there is the fact that the wood the house is built out of was not milled by me, etc. The inherent sin and whatnot.
    </div><div>
        Well, I thought a really great way of being mindful of that is after creating that thing, writing a list of all of the things I -should- have had in order to make it. Not the tools, but the materials of making it and that list would be sequestered into whatever the thing is that I'm making as an inherent part of it as an acquiescience to the inherent sin I have not attempted to mitigate. Though, if I wanted to be even more strict, the tools could hypothetically be a part of this acquiescience.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">The Discipline: </span> Earlier, I was outside and even though I'm not being productive and actively creating anything, I feel like even just dipping my toe into this space is good. It might not be productive but it's discipline. And that's very very good. What's weird though is  this is pretty comfortable. Only consuming media from 1993 and beyond is pretty easy for me. It's almost too easy that I'm concerned.
    </div><div>
        I'm wondering if it's too easy. The main emphasis is removing myself from the culture of consumption and I'm wondering if the ease in which I find this is mainly because of my age. This music is the music of my youth so it's not a hardship for me. Though, I was thinking about it from the perspective of video games, and hypothetically, it is literally possible (if I just include mainstream console roms, arcade game roms and PC games) to download all video games up until that point, which is pretty crazy. Though, each year that passes, that will become exponentionally more difficult. Though, I don't know how gratifying those games could be. I think it's fine. 
    </div><div>
        I was thinking also, about the possibility of tying it to a fixed point like 4380 and all media after that point is haram, but I don't really want my life to be that stagnant. I'm open to the idea of another more strict interpretation when there's actual people to involve themselves with this and that wouldn't be an ascetic pursuit.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">Timer: </span> I found something to be productive about. I set a timer multiple times using Alexa and then with my phone, so I realized, I could program a rudimentary timer on the metric clock page here to be able to keep track of time and have a better sense of metric time. I started work on it but I'm about to eat and there's a bunch of ingredients that I don't feel like writing down (=p) so I'm going to end it now.
    </div>

    <h3>August 8, 2024 (13:20 [1.76EK] - 21:16 [34.6EK]) </h3>
    <div>
        <span class='category'>Monasticism:</span> I was just reading a biography about the guy who made paper from wood pulp for the first time and they mentioned Martin Luther and how he was a monk. Considering this whole enterprise is about being a monk, I thought I'd read about him. One thing I never thought about in terms of this whole project is trying to continue these Holy Days past that day. I never saw the utility in it until I read a characterization of the committment of Martin Luther to monastic life and I realized maybe I need to start evaluating another aspect of these days : length of time. I nornmally just do a few hours and call it a day, but maybe I can do this over a few days?
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>TMJ:</span> My TMJ got worse today. Though, I'm not sure why. It got bad yesterday as well around the same time, after eating my middle meal, so I don'tk now if that has something to do with it. Today, though, my jaw started to ache instead of just the normal tightness and I got concerned it was some kind of infection. It's fine now though an hour or two later. I still won't be eating any solid foods for the next month or so. I keep wondering what it could be.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Papermaking:</span> So I got all ready to make some paper and I think the paper vat is officially donezo from the last time I made paper which was, if memory serves me correctly, about 150g of shredded paper which netted maybe about 8 relatively small bits of recycled paper. On the biggest one, I could not get hardly any paper onto the mold and the smallest one, I could get some but not enough to cover it sufficiently. I think before I finish today, I'll shred the paper I do have and start looking into what is required for turning rags into paper. (It appears that it's literally just soaking fabric in water.) Because I'm so low, I might start looking into integrating cardboard into the process. I'm definitely not going to be ready to start making it from wood pulp until I get something to shred wood.    There's a shredder from Harbor Freight for 1.5 inches but that seems really, really small to the point of not being useful. I might try it though just for how cheap it is. I found a few used ones online that might not be too bad but I'd probably have to have a truck for that to be viable. 
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Towel:</span> I strung together about six pairs of socks, side by side and end to end to make a small towel. It was quite laborious to make it but I'm glad I finished. I wished it looked more like a towel than just a bunch of socks sewn together but I think it will suffice for a towel for now.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Clothing:</span> I made a shirt really quick because I was feeling good about making a towel. I did some basic measurements on myself but then just decided to make straight lines on the fitted sheet I was using and then fold it in half and use the pattern I had made previously for a robe. It's a little too big in the shoulder but I think that's better than the alternative. Also, it's a little too tight in the thighs when I sit down but overally, it's okay.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Metric Time / Programming:</span> I made it to where the programmed solar noon was the default entry for the text field, so I don't have to continually keep looking it up over and over again in the solar noon calculator link. Also made the link open up a new window instead of that window. Created universal time so that I'm not just overly dependent on Earth Metric Time
    </div><div>
        I had an idea for metric time to distinguish in shorthand between Earth and Universal time. e and u are obvious but because I will likely abbreviate the time to 10.1k or 25.1k. I can maybe abbreviate it to 20.5EK or 20.5UK to distinguish between the two succintly. Though, for Universal Time, yeah, 4.4 million days is super unwieldy. Maybe there's another shorthand that can be applied there. The current Universal Date as it is currently calculated is 4,391,859. Maybe everything above 1,000 is just assumed or is in a different frame of reference. So the date is 859 and the context of that date is 4.391 million or 4,391. Not quite as unwieldy. Though, the term for that can't really be year because year has too much semantic baggage. Maybe cycle? 4,391 cycles and 859 days. I don't think days necessarily has the same kind of semantic baggage as year does. For most people, it doesn't necessarily mean the solar day just your biological day. Maybe we can make that distinction clearer by making it a metric day. Actually, let's just try that distinction now in the clock.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Holy Day Protocol:</span> I decided that in terms of logging interactions, I no longer need to log things that are related to the infrastructure I am created. So the sewing machine I used today to make clothes, not something I need to log. I used wood glue and some other stuff to make the deckle today. Not necessary to log that. Once I reach the bottom of the infrastructure (not sure if that's the best way to describe it), only then would I focus on being able to make the tools that are used to make the things that I make.
    </div>
    <h3>August 7, 2024 (12:20 - 16:02 [12.8k]) </h3>
    <div>
        I started out working on the clock. Instead of having to update the JS code with solar noon, you can now just set the solar noon on the page. The next steps are to have it automatically do that (not sure if I can do that with client-side javascript) and to be able to convert regular time to metric time. 
    </div><div>
        I've mostly run out of paper that I've created for this project so I have to start making more. Using these sheets made me question why they're not flat and they're kinda crumpled up. I figure it has something to do with how it dried. Maybe I need to leave it under a press for like a week to get all the moisture out. My vat that I've been using for paper had a dead cricket in it and I finally got it out. My Mom also accidentally threw the dryer lint directly into it instead of the box above so we'll see if that had any kind of effect. Also, today, I figured out why the mold and deckle (might be messing up the terms) are two separate pieces. My mold and deckle are all one piece. You dip it in and then you have to kind of tap it against the surface once it's dried a little bit. (I'm using window screen and it goes between two pieces, so it goes under the mold and gets stuck there.) Today, I only waited a half hour instead of the hour or two and it just torn into pieces because it was so wet. But if the mold could come off and I could lay it out flat, I don't think that would have been as much of an issue. I'm working on a new one right now, so we'll see if that's something I can integrate into the process.
    </div><div>
        It's weird that the mold in mold and deckle for papermaking does not refer to the thing that literally molds it into the shape of paper.
    </div><div>
        Last time I did this, I realized that my sheet and pillow are another interaction that I may not have previously logged. So I haev this big bag of socks that my uncle gave me before he died, I thought maybe I could make a blanket out of that but I think I might make a towel instead since they're relatively similar fabric. Socks aren't flat when you cut them so it'll be interesting how I work around that project. I was only able to string together three before the string on the sewing machine broke at the needle. I just hate threading the bobbin on this because its so goddamn difficult.
    </div><div>
        Yeah, I might need a new sewing machine. The string keeps breaking after I rethread the needle. So I think I figured out whatever the issue was with it breakign when I rethreaded the needle. But now it's getting stuck in the bobbin and the bobbin thread broke. 
    </div><div>
        So instead of waiting a half hour to let the paper dry, I waited a full hour. Still tore when I started tapping it to get it loose. I think another contributing factor is there's not as much paper in it, so its a thinner paper than usual. I think I'll have to wait until I complete the new deckle.
    </div><div>
        I feel good that I worked on two different aspects of the project, but I feel bad I didn't really accomplish anythig meaningful, which is how I felt last time. The only progress from last time (outside of learning) was that I finally moved my PC monitor down to the desk so I'm not straining my eyes anymore.
    </div><div>
        I keep thinking about the scope of this project and it just feels so unmanageable. Obviously, it's a huge project, but it feels like progress just never gets made. Maybe I'm not doing it enough and that might be because I'm not getting any success in the process. =(
    </div><div>
        One thing I did have a little bit of insight about though is the importance of previous work, if that makes any kind of sense. I was able to work on making paper and making a towel based on doing it previously.
    </div>
    
    <h3>
        July 27, 2024 (12:47 - 15:57)
    </h3><div>
        I didn't have much time before work but I figured a couple hours would be good. Sometimes, when I do this, I get SO BORED, I just take a nap. Which is what I did for about two hours. Most of the time though, I was working on figuring out how to make my own ink. I made my own paper recently and I have enough for about one or two more sessions besides this one. The paper isn't very good. It's rough and I have to use a marker instead of a pen to be able to write consistently. But I was reading this book called 40,000 Years Of Ink (or something like that). 
    </div><div>
        I downgrade my setup as much as feasibly possibly when I do these sessions to try and replicate a future DIY computer setup. So I have an older style Ubuntu desktop I switch to for these sessions. For ease of use, I just plugged it into the VGA port on my TV but my TV is about a foot or two above my eye line and I don't know if it's because of that, because it's VGA, or because it's a TV but it is exceedingly uncomfortable to try to read digital books from there. Definitely gotta get that fixed.
    </div><div>
        A while back, I had created a new system of measuring time which I'm tentatively calling Metric Time. Instead of the system of there ~84,000 seconds per day and 60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day, there would be just 100,000 metric seconds, starting from solar noon. Yesterday, I realized how important it was to start doing that again during this project. 
    </div><div>
        Though, I did realize a short-coming of Metric Time just yesterday as well. Metric Time is based on the solar noon of whereever you happen to be locally. The problem with that is if you're coordinating across just a couple hours  away from each other, there's a time difference. From where I live now and just two hours away, there's a five minute time difference between solar noons. There will actually be two different systems of this metric time though. One is Earth-based which would vary the number of second per day around the literal metric second (So some days would be 100,005. Some more. Some less.) and days would be sequestered in months and years. Then there's universal time which has just a strict 100k cyclical metric second day from a single point and years aren't 365 days. They're either 100 days or 1000 days. And that's it. So, hypothetically, people could coordinate in universal time if they were so inclined.
    </div><div>
        One thing I've been having a bit of issue with, emotionally, is that I'm just not making a lot of progress. The first time I started keeping track of Holy Days was June 12th, and I did bits and pieces of progress like a program to keep track of Metric Time but it wasn't until July 22 that I first started using the paper that I had made. Considering the overall scope of the progress, that seems unnecessarily slow, but I also don't have a lot of money to invest in the project. And some of the projects just seem extremely daunting, like a DIY computer. Even the most basic computer seems like a project that is significantly out of my wheelhouse. 
    </div><div>
        There's another aspect which is that I'm only keeping track of things outside of the context that I am in a house, using furniture, using software, and consuming media that is not part of The Organization.
    </div><div>
        So, yeah, I mainly just read about the history of making ink, napped and read one of the books in The Expanse series.
    </div><div>
        <em> the following was not from this original project. it was actually part of the whole Stewardship project that predates The Monastery of the White Tiger. I'm including it for posterity.</em>
    </div>
    <div>
        On July 4, 2022, I started taking one day out of the week to live a more Stewardship-oriented life. This is my written record of that.
    </div><div style='font-weight:bold;'>
        July 4, 20222 Monday	
    </div><div>
        The day that I started. It's hard for me to describe the motivation for this, but I'll try. I read a really great tweet from Nassim Taleb. It was a link to a Medium article that itself was an excerpted chapter from his book: Skin In The Game. The chapter in question posits the utility of cultural intolerance and how larger society must adapt to that group's intolerance as a reaction. (Intolerance may be an indelicate word but I think it's relatively accurate.) The example he gives is: within the Jewish population, it's very important that dairy and meat be Kosher. On nearly every dairy and meat product in America there is an inconspicuous little symbol to indicate that it is Kosher. Anti-semitism considerations aside, why would dairy and meat producers make do this when Jewish people make up less than 3% of the population? Because -not- doing it is a guaranteed loss and it doesn't take that much effort to comply. 
    </div><div>
        Liberals, such as myself, place a lot of unquestioned value in tolerance. Even conservatives will use the term 'the tolerant left' to ridicule liberals when they object to some kind of 'cancelling'. 
    </div><div>
        The philosophy behind Stewardship started a while ago, but when I read that excerpt, I tried to think of core cultural values from Stewardship that could be encapsulated in a shield of intolerance. What aspects of Stewardship are so important that nothing less could ever be accepted? 
    </div><div>
        There are more important aspects of Stewardship, (namely servicing a community) but one very important aspect is this:
    </div><div><q>
        The Steward creates and should therefore strive to only consume products of their own creation. If they are unable to, the consumption or utilization of an object or objects created by another Steward (preferably one close in their lineage) shall suffice. The only exception to this rule is that Stewards may use tools from any creator but they should strive even in this situation to make their own tools.
    </q></div><div>
        It's a fundamental precept. It's what the entire foundation of Stewardship is built on and theoretically, what separates us from more casual philathropic work. 
    </div><div>
        So, for one day out of the week, I will go out of my way to avoid using or consuming products or things that are not created by me. This is difficult. I am a consumer in a consumer-driven society. Consumption is everything. But it's an endeavor I think will help me get started in the right mindset for Stewardship. 

    </div><div>
        My day starts some time after noon time when I wake up, but I wanted it to be clearly on Monday, so I started it at midnight July 4, 2022, Monday. A different kind of independence. 
    </div><div>
        I had to make a lot of exceptions. Some of them are obvious: food, water, medicine, clothing, sewage, because I don't have a way of creating those immediately from the beginning. Another couple exceptions I made were: electric lighting, refrigeration, cooking, running water, and soap. Refrigeration, cooking, running water and soap are all basic because they're all foundations of modern society. Technically, I probably could get by without refrigeration, and I'm going to try to figure out how, eventually. Cooking is kind of necessary, because I eat 3 cups of beans per day for its fiber content, but I'm still going to try to create a more integrated system for that as well. Electric lights are just a guilty pleasure, mainly because I will be awake from dusk to about 6am and it would be really unpleasant if I had to be in the dark and unable to read during tha time. 
    </div><div>
        It gets very hot where I live, because I'm in the desert. But, for now, I won't be allowing air conditioning. Though, I am renting a room, so I won't always have control over that because I have to consider the people I live with.

    </div><div>
        I am planning on creating these basic necessities in the future. Making my own clothes, making my own shoes, making my own bedding, my own food, harvesting rainwater and purifying it,  etc. But this is an inaugaural test to see what I need.
    </div><div>
        Now some people might be looking on this at an abstract level and question what I'm actually accomplishing considering how much I do have, but I guess I should say what I won't have access to. Video games, Internet, computing, television, most forms of music. This is what 90% of my life is right now and I'm taking that away. I am allowing the ability to receive phone calls just out of courtesy to my Mom and to record videos on my phone to document what's happening, but that's it. No Internet access. I'm also allowing paper and pen just to be able to write stuff down and because I have almost too much paper that I need to work towards getting rid of. Most of my entertainment will be books that I've been meaning to read. I am planning, eventually, to allow a Raspberry PI, because I should go through my small collection of books pretty quickly and digital books are more accessible and cheaper. I would prefer that Raspberry PI to be run off solar but I probably won't have enough money to do that, but I'll allow it if I can get Linux From Scratch running on it. (Thankfully, someone's already doing that project.)
    </div><div>
        I thought about simplifying the cooking prcoess down by using a barbeque instead of a stove, microwave or oven, but I feel like that's not really helping in terms of being able to create that, because I'd still be depedent on commercial charcoal as a fuel source. Plus, I'm not making the barbeque. Though, I could do a campfire situation, but still would be dependent on commercial charcoal or commercial firewood.

    </div><div>
        I guess it's important to talk about what I'm NOT trying to do. It's not important that I be able to create a light bult from its constituent elemental parts, like blowing the glass, creating the filament, and all that. That is the ideal, but it's not that important. What's most important is that I understand the underlying processes behind every system that I am involved in. For example, I thought about creating my own operating system, but at the end of the day, I'm most likely going to make it work with Linux anyways, so why bother? There's no point in reinventing the wheel, when the wheel is going to do the same thing as any other wheel. Maybe some future generation of Stewards will feel it's necessary to physically fabricate CPUs, but it's probably not going to be me.
    </div><div>
        When I started, I genuinely didn't think I was going to be able to do it for the whole 24 hours. I went without power a couple weeks before this and it was so annoying and frustrating, and that was during the day.
    </div><div>
        As soon as I started, I realized without electricity, I wouldn't be able to know what time it is. Thankfully, I still had my grandfather's pocket watch, so I used that. It wasn't completely reliable. At one point, around 6pm or so, it just stopped working. I wound it up but it stopped again shortly after. I had to wind it all the way and it finally continued working. I can't rely on that entirely, so I'll be working on a sun dial and a water clock.
    </div><div>
        I made another exception for thermometers. I get anxiety when I feel really hot and I don't know why. I start to think I might be sick and in this time of covid, I wonder if I might have caught it. Plus, given that I live in the desert, I think it would be nice to know how hot it's going to be at a given time. It didn't get too hot that day. I think it peaked at 88 degrees. For some reason, I didn't really find the heat intolerable until around 8pm. I don't know why. I don't think it was the humidity. I woke up around 2pm and it was at 86, so it didn't even really change that much. Maybe it was just being in 80+ degree temperatures for an extended period of time.
    </div><div>
        I had a bag of old clothes that I had hoped to eventually repurpose into something else. So when this started, I went through it to figure out what I could turn it into. The one rule I had was that I couldn't turn old underwear into new underwear or old shirts into new shirts. It had to be recycled into something new. Unfortuantely, nothing really seemed adequate for what I needed to make, so I decided to order some fabric to make clothes instead. 
    </div><div>
        I made another exception: using the washing machine. In this case though, I'm not using the washing machine for this day, I'm using it to be able to clear off some blankets from my bed. Either way, it's going to go in the washing machine, so it makes no difference if I throw it in now or later. You could make an argument that I'm cheating, but there's almost no situation in which I'm going to wash blankets by hand when another option is available.  
    </div><div>
        Another exception that I'm actually lowkey ashamed of: soda. There's no actual justification for this other than my addiction. This day would be so much more unpleasant if I couldn't drink soda. I might start drinking it unrefrigerated if I reach a point in the process where that's the the only refrigerated item I'm consuming. I'd like to be able to create my own but I drink diet soda so that's a little bit more tricky. 
    </div><div>
        One insight I had during this test run was that if I had a job, this would make things very difficult. Because I have to withdraw almost entirely from society in order to do this. (I am planning on adding other restrictions like not talking to non-Stewards when that becomes viable.) When I eventually get one, I'll have to just change it to once a week, or change the day to accomodate my work, but Monday will probably always be the restrictive intolerance day. Then I realized this isn't really intended for lay people. Stewardship has always been intended as a Monastic order. 
    </div><div>
        For the most part, it wasn't really that difficult, but once it reached around 10pm, I was really looking forward to midnight. July 4th wasn't ideal, because I had to have the window open but people kept setting off fireworks for the holiday. I spent most of my day reading and was able to finish off two books. 
    </div><div>
        The main project I worked on that day and afterwards was making some sandals. The specific type is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paduka'>paduka</a> I had some particle board, a dowel and some scrap I was able to make into it. Unfortuantely, it doesn't have the heel and toe like the one in the link. It's just flat. I also didn't shape it like a foot because I figured it wasn't important for testing. I'm writing this entry a few days after July 4th, and I just finished the sandals a couple days ago. They aren't great. They're barely functional. It's not pleasant walking on pieces of wood, obviously. But I'm concerned that I might injure myself by the particle board breaking in half or the dowel breaking and I'm going to stab myself in the foot. So, I'll probably use it only this Monday, but I'm going to try to make a new pair of sandals from rope.
    </div><div>
        One exception I never noticed until after I had already done it was tissues. I'm making an exception for toilet paper, because the current alternative is much worse, but with tissues it's relatively trivial to make some hankies. So that's another project. 
    </div><div>
        One assumption that I made when starting this project is that I would not be able to create my own shelter in order to do this. While doing the test run though, I was in the garage, enjoying a cross breeze between the back door and front door. And I thought, it'd be nice if I could be in a place where it was possible to feel a breeze from all directions. Then I realized all I need is a tent of some kind. This isn't impossible, but there are a LOT of ants in both yards. Just when I was in the garage, I had to keep constant watch of the ants crawling in to make sure they don't bite me. And there's really no great place to set it up in the backyard. If I do set up a tent, I will also have to create a special structure to avoid the ants as well.
    </div><div>
        All in all, I think it was a good experience but there were a few different thing I need to make sure I've already done beforehand next time: cover all clocks, clean dishes in the dishwasher, and have my beans already cooked.
