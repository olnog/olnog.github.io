    <h3>August 20, 2024 [c:4,391 d:870] (18:25 [u:46k] - : [u: k]) </h3>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Negligence</span>:</span> It's been too long since I've done this. Even if I don't accomplish anything, it's more important to put myself in this mindset and focus on a small aspect of it than it is to be 'productive'. Not engaging in this mindset is negligence.
    </div>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Metric Time:</span> I don't like the way metric time looks written as 5.5UK. UK is to readily identifiable as 'United Kingom' and I think "u:5.5k" is a slightly clearer way of putting things than the previous way. (Maybe...)
    </div>
    <div>
        <span class="category">Holy Day Protocol: </span> Now that I've started to keep track of what programs I use, there is a general guideline that I should always use the simplest version of something. (Though, to be fair, I'm using a pen now but that's just because I significantly prefer pens over pencils and have some crappys ones I could use up before I go back to pencils.) I'm making an exception for the program I use to write this. In an ideal world, I would just be using a text editor to write this. Maybe even something as spartan as a cli text editor. (vi) But for sake of ergonimics, readiability and usability, I decided to just use an IDE because git is integrated directly into it.
    </div><div>
        Also, today I've started to keep track of any media I might consume during this time period. Media is defined as anything fictional, music, or art in the general sense of the term. I'm allowing some media to be grandfathered in. Neal Stephenson's Anathem. (obviously) And I was thinking about historical media but I'm not really sure what date would be good. If the current cycle is 4,391, what about everything from cycle 4000 and beyond? Which begs the question: what year is that?
    </div><div>
        So that's super far. As I was writing the Javascript algorithm to calculate it back to regular years, I realized metric seconds doesn't really matter in this calculation. (It does for more accuracy.) But for the most part, a day is a day, so 391 cycles is just 391,000 days which is 1071 years ago. That's a lot further than what I had anticipated and I really don't want to be reading stuff that predates Shakespeare. So let's try 100 cycles: 273 years. 273 years is still further than I  would like. Lemme see what kind of reading material I'd have from Internet Archive.  Yeah, it's not great. It's not completely intolerable from a consumption standpoint but it's not ideal. So let's do 10 cycles but let's also include the current date as well. Ten cycles ago was roughly 29.8 years ago which would put it at 1994. Very, very doable. Almost too easy. The idea is to remove myself from the consumption of media and 1994 is three generations ago, so that's not too bad. Actually, let me look at my collection of media. Music, (because I'm old) I think will be a lot easier to find old stuff, but for TV shows and movies, let's see. 
    </div><div>
        I forgot that my external hard drive where I keep all my media isn't accessible on this computer so, yeah, we'll call it. All media from before ten cycles and I guess I gotta create an app to figure out it's our equivalent of haram. (Oh, wow, I forgot about video games. That's very interesting to me as a potential thing.) Though, this does put an interesting predicament in terms of data storage, because I think I have to seegment my data storage in terms of haram and halal. 
    </div><div>        
        <span class="category">Terminology: </span> I have couched things before this in terms of 'sin' as an appeal to give The Organization a religious or at the very least, a spiritual appeal. With this recent entry, I'm characterizing things as 'haram' and 'halal' which makes me feel anxious, but then I realize that this is just the inherent Islamaphobia of being an American in America so it will stay. Though, I wonder in which case the terms 'sin' and 'haram/halal' would be appropriate, because they are not interchangeable. For the purposes of this document, I will be characterizing inherent characteristics of people and behavior (though not necessarily behavior of people) as sin and the inherent characteristic of things that are not people as 'haram' and 'halal'. I don't know if this is on par for the actual usage of these terms within their respective relgions but it feels natural to me.
    </div><div>
        <span class="category">The Divinity of Infrastructure: </span> This is kind of a wild idea but I was thinking about how I don't keep track of the fact that I'm in a house I didn't build, typing on a desk I didn't build, etc. And I was thinking about that inevitable moment when I will build my own house and desk and I'll have to keep track of those kinds of things, but then there is the fact that the wood the house is built out of was not milled by me, etc. The inherent sin and whatnot.
    </div><div>
        Well, I thought a really great way of being mindful of that is after creating that thing, writing a list of all of the things I -should- have had in order to make it. Not the tools, but the materials of making it and that list would be sequestered into whatever the thing is that I'm making as an inherent part of it as an acquiescience to the inherent sin I have not attempted to mitigate. Though, if I wanted to be even more strict, the tools could hypothetically be a part of this acquiescience.

    <h3>August 8, 2024 (13:20 [1.76EK] - 21:16 [34.6EK]) </h3>
    <div>
        <span class='category'>Monasticism:</span> I was just reading a biography about the guy who made paper from wood pulp for the first time and they mentioned Martin Luther and how he was a monk. Considering this whole enterprise is about being a monk, I thought I'd read about him. One thing I never thought about in terms of this whole project is trying to continue these Holy Days past that day. I never saw the utility in it until I read a characterization of the committment of Martin Luther to monastic life and I realized maybe I need to start evaluating another aspect of these days : length of time. I nornmally just do a few hours and call it a day, but maybe I can do this over a few days?
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>TMJ:</span> My TMJ got worse today. Though, I'm not sure why. It got bad yesterday as well around the same time, after eating my middle meal, so I don'tk now if that has something to do with it. Today, though, my jaw started to ache instead of just the normal tightness and I got concerned it was some kind of infection. It's fine now though an hour or two later. I still won't be eating any solid foods for the next month or so. I keep wondering what it could be.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Papermaking:</span> So I got all ready to make some paper and I think the paper vat is officially donezo from the last time I made paper which was, if memory serves me correctly, about 150g of shredded paper which netted maybe about 8 relatively small bits of recycled paper. On the biggest one, I could not get hardly any paper onto the mold and the smallest one, I could get some but not enough to cover it sufficiently. I think before I finish today, I'll shred the paper I do have and start looking into what is required for turning rags into paper. (It appears that it's literally just soaking fabric in water.) Because I'm so low, I might start looking into integrating cardboard into the process. I'm definitely not going to be ready to start making it from wood pulp until I get something to shred wood.    There's a shredder from Harbor Freight for 1.5 inches but that seems really, really small to the point of not being useful. I might try it though just for how cheap it is. I found a few used ones online that might not be too bad but I'd probably have to have a truck for that to be viable. 
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Towel:</span> I strung together about six pairs of socks, side by side and end to end to make a small towel. It was quite laborious to make it but I'm glad I finished. I wished it looked more like a towel than just a bunch of socks sewn together but I think it will suffice for a towel for now.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Clothing:</span> I made a shirt really quick because I was feeling good about making a towel. I did some basic measurements on myself but then just decided to make straight lines on the fitted sheet I was using and then fold it in half and use the pattern I had made previously for a robe. It's a little too big in the shoulder but I think that's better than the alternative. Also, it's a little too tight in the thighs when I sit down but overally, it's okay.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Metric Time / Programming:</span> I made it to where the programmed solar noon was the default entry for the text field, so I don't have to continually keep looking it up over and over again in the solar noon calculator link. Also made the link open up a new window instead of that window. Created universal time so that I'm not just overly dependent on Earth Metric Time
    </div><div>
        I had an idea for metric time to distinguish in shorthand between Earth and Universal time. e and u are obvious but because I will likely abbreviate the time to 10.1k or 25.1k. I can maybe abbreviate it to 20.5EK or 20.5UK to distinguish between the two succintly. Though, for Universal Time, yeah, 4.4 million days is super unwieldy. Maybe there's another shorthand that can be applied there. The current Universal Date as it is currently calculated is 4,391,859. Maybe everything above 1,000 is just assumed or is in a different frame of reference. So the date is 859 and the context of that date is 4.391 million or 4,391. Not quite as unwieldy. Though, the term for that can't really be year because year has too much semantic baggage. Maybe cycle? 4,391 cycles and 859 days. I don't think days necessarily has the same kind of semantic baggage as year does. For most people, it doesn't necessarily mean the solar day just your biological day. Maybe we can make that distinction clearer by making it a metric day. Actually, let's just try that distinction now in the clock.
    </div><div>
        <span class='category'>Holy Day Protocol:</span> I decided that in terms of logging interactions, I no longer need to log things that are related to the infrastructure I am created. So the sewing machine I used today to make clothes, not something I need to log. I used wood glue and some other stuff to make the deckle today. Not necessary to log that. Once I reach the bottom of the infrastructure (not sure if that's the best way to describe it), only then would I focus on being able to make the tools that are used to make the things that I make.
    </div>
    <h3>August 7, 2024 (12:20 - 16:02 [12.8k]) </h3>
    <div>
        I started out working on the clock. Instead of having to update the JS code with solar noon, you can now just set the solar noon on the page. The next steps are to have it automatically do that (not sure if I can do that with client-side javascript) and to be able to convert regular time to metric time. 
    </div><div>
        I've mostly run out of paper that I've created for this project so I have to start making more. Using these sheets made me question why they're not flat and they're kinda crumpled up. I figure it has something to do with how it dried. Maybe I need to leave it under a press for like a week to get all the moisture out. My vat that I've been using for paper had a dead cricket in it and I finally got it out. My Mom also accidentally threw the dryer lint directly into it instead of the box above so we'll see if that had any kind of effect. Also, today, I figured out why the mold and deckle (might be messing up the terms) are two separate pieces. My mold and deckle are all one piece. You dip it in and then you have to kind of tap it against the surface once it's dried a little bit. (I'm using window screen and it goes between two pieces, so it goes under the mold and gets stuck there.) Today, I only waited a half hour instead of the hour or two and it just torn into pieces because it was so wet. But if the mold could come off and I could lay it out flat, I don't think that would have been as much of an issue. I'm working on a new one right now, so we'll see if that's something I can integrate into the process.
    </div><div>
        It's weird that the mold in mold and deckle for papermaking does not refer to the thing that literally molds it into the shape of paper.
    </div><div>
        Last time I did this, I realized that my sheet and pillow are another interaction that I may not have previously logged. So I haev this big bag of socks that my uncle gave me before he died, I thought maybe I could make a blanket out of that but I think I might make a towel instead since they're relatively similar fabric. Socks aren't flat when you cut them so it'll be interesting how I work around that project. I was only able to string together three before the string on the sewing machine broke at the needle. I just hate threading the bobbin on this because its so goddamn difficult.
    </div><div>
        Yeah, I might need a new sewing machine. The string keeps breaking after I rethread the needle. So I think I figured out whatever the issue was with it breakign when I rethreaded the needle. But now it's getting stuck in the bobbin and the bobbin thread broke. 
    </div><div>
        So instead of waiting a half hour to let the paper dry, I waited a full hour. Still tore when I started tapping it to get it loose. I think another contributing factor is there's not as much paper in it, so its a thinner paper than usual. I think I'll have to wait until I complete the new deckle.
    </div><div>
        I feel good that I worked on two different aspects of the project, but I feel bad I didn't really accomplish anythig meaningful, which is how I felt last time. The only progress from last time (outside of learning) was that I finally moved my PC monitor down to the desk so I'm not straining my eyes anymore.
    </div><div>
        I keep thinking about the scope of this project and it just feels so unmanageable. Obviously, it's a huge project, but it feels like progress just never gets made. Maybe I'm not doing it enough and that might be because I'm not getting any success in the process. =(
    </div><div>
        One thing I did have a little bit of insight about though is the importance of previous work, if that makes any kind of sense. I was able to work on making paper and making a towel based on doing it previously.
    </div>
    
    <h3>
        July 27, 2024 (12:47 - 15:57)
    </h3><div>
        I didn't have much time before work but I figured a couple hours would be good. Sometimes, when I do this, I get SO BORED, I just take a nap. Which is what I did for about two hours. Most of the time though, I was working on figuring out how to make my own ink. I made my own paper recently and I have enough for about one or two more sessions besides this one. The paper isn't very good. It's rough and I have to use a marker instead of a pen to be able to write consistently. But I was reading this book called 40,000 Years Of Ink (or something like that). 
    </div><div>
        I downgrade my setup as much as feasibly possibly when I do these sessions to try and replicate a future DIY computer setup. So I have an older style Ubuntu desktop I switch to for these sessions. For ease of use, I just plugged it into the VGA port on my TV but my TV is about a foot or two above my eye line and I don't know if it's because of that, because it's VGA, or because it's a TV but it is exceedingly uncomfortable to try to read digital books from there. Definitely gotta get that fixed.
    </div><div>
        A while back, I had created a new system of measuring time which I'm tentatively calling Metric Time. Instead of the system of there ~84,000 seconds per day and 60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day, there would be just 100,000 metric seconds, starting from solar noon. Yesterday, I realized how important it was to start doing that again during this project. 
    </div><div>
        Though, I did realize a short-coming of Metric Time just yesterday as well. Metric Time is based on the solar noon of whereever you happen to be locally. The problem with that is if you're coordinating across just a couple hours  away from each other, there's a time difference. From where I live now and just two hours away, there's a five minute time difference between solar noons. There will actually be two different systems of this metric time though. One is Earth-based which would vary the number of second per day around the literal metric second (So some days would be 100,005. Some more. Some less.) and days would be sequestered in months and years. Then there's universal time which has just a strict 100k cyclical metric second day from a single point and years aren't 365 days. They're either 100 days or 1000 days. And that's it. So, hypothetically, people could coordinate in universal time if they were so inclined.
    </div><div>
        One thing I've been having a bit of issue with, emotionally, is that I'm just not making a lot of progress. The first time I started keeping track of Holy Days was June 12th, and I did bits and pieces of progress like a program to keep track of Metric Time but it wasn't until July 22 that I first started using the paper that I had made. Considering the overall scope of the progress, that seems unnecessarily slow, but I also don't have a lot of money to invest in the project. And some of the projects just seem extremely daunting, like a DIY computer. Even the most basic computer seems like a project that is significantly out of my wheelhouse. 
    </div><div>
        There's another aspect which is that I'm only keeping track of things outside of the context that I am in a house, using furniture, using software, and consuming media that is not part of The Organization.
    </div><div>
        So, yeah, I mainly just read about the history of making ink, napped and read one of the books in The Expanse series.
    </div><div>
        <em> the following was not from this original project. it was actually part of the whole Stewardship project that predates The Monastery of the White Tiger. I'm including it for posterity.</em>
    </div>
    <div>
        On July 4, 2022, I started taking one day out of the week to live a more Stewardship-oriented life. This is my written record of that.
    </div><div style='font-weight:bold;'>
        July 4, 20222 Monday	
    </div><div>
        The day that I started. It's hard for me to describe the motivation for this, but I'll try. I read a really great tweet from Nassim Taleb. It was a link to a Medium article that itself was an excerpted chapter from his book: Skin In The Game. The chapter in question posits the utility of cultural intolerance and how larger society must adapt to that group's intolerance as a reaction. (Intolerance may be an indelicate word but I think it's relatively accurate.) The example he gives is: within the Jewish population, it's very important that dairy and meat be Kosher. On nearly every dairy and meat product in America there is an inconspicuous little symbol to indicate that it is Kosher. Anti-semitism considerations aside, why would dairy and meat producers make do this when Jewish people make up less than 3% of the population? Because -not- doing it is a guaranteed loss and it doesn't take that much effort to comply. 
    </div><div>
        Liberals, such as myself, place a lot of unquestioned value in tolerance. Even conservatives will use the term 'the tolerant left' to ridicule liberals when they object to some kind of 'cancelling'. 
    </div><div>
        The philosophy behind Stewardship started a while ago, but when I read that excerpt, I tried to think of core cultural values from Stewardship that could be encapsulated in a shield of intolerance. What aspects of Stewardship are so important that nothing less could ever be accepted? 
    </div><div>
        There are more important aspects of Stewardship, (namely servicing a community) but one very important aspect is this:
    </div><div><q>
        The Steward creates and should therefore strive to only consume products of their own creation. If they are unable to, the consumption or utilization of an object or objects created by another Steward (preferably one close in their lineage) shall suffice. The only exception to this rule is that Stewards may use tools from any creator but they should strive even in this situation to make their own tools.
    </q></div><div>
        It's a fundamental precept. It's what the entire foundation of Stewardship is built on and theoretically, what separates us from more casual philathropic work. 
    </div><div>
        So, for one day out of the week, I will go out of my way to avoid using or consuming products or things that are not created by me. This is difficult. I am a consumer in a consumer-driven society. Consumption is everything. But it's an endeavor I think will help me get started in the right mindset for Stewardship. 

    </div><div>
        My day starts some time after noon time when I wake up, but I wanted it to be clearly on Monday, so I started it at midnight July 4, 2022, Monday. A different kind of independence. 
    </div><div>
        I had to make a lot of exceptions. Some of them are obvious: food, water, medicine, clothing, sewage, because I don't have a way of creating those immediately from the beginning. Another couple exceptions I made were: electric lighting, refrigeration, cooking, running water, and soap. Refrigeration, cooking, running water and soap are all basic because they're all foundations of modern society. Technically, I probably could get by without refrigeration, and I'm going to try to figure out how, eventually. Cooking is kind of necessary, because I eat 3 cups of beans per day for its fiber content, but I'm still going to try to create a more integrated system for that as well. Electric lights are just a guilty pleasure, mainly because I will be awake from dusk to about 6am and it would be really unpleasant if I had to be in the dark and unable to read during tha time. 
    </div><div>
        It gets very hot where I live, because I'm in the desert. But, for now, I won't be allowing air conditioning. Though, I am renting a room, so I won't always have control over that because I have to consider the people I live with.

    </div><div>
        I am planning on creating these basic necessities in the future. Making my own clothes, making my own shoes, making my own bedding, my own food, harvesting rainwater and purifying it,  etc. But this is an inaugaural test to see what I need.
    </div><div>
        Now some people might be looking on this at an abstract level and question what I'm actually accomplishing considering how much I do have, but I guess I should say what I won't have access to. Video games, Internet, computing, television, most forms of music. This is what 90% of my life is right now and I'm taking that away. I am allowing the ability to receive phone calls just out of courtesy to my Mom and to record videos on my phone to document what's happening, but that's it. No Internet access. I'm also allowing paper and pen just to be able to write stuff down and because I have almost too much paper that I need to work towards getting rid of. Most of my entertainment will be books that I've been meaning to read. I am planning, eventually, to allow a Raspberry PI, because I should go through my small collection of books pretty quickly and digital books are more accessible and cheaper. I would prefer that Raspberry PI to be run off solar but I probably won't have enough money to do that, but I'll allow it if I can get Linux From Scratch running on it. (Thankfully, someone's already doing that project.)
    </div><div>
        I thought about simplifying the cooking prcoess down by using a barbeque instead of a stove, microwave or oven, but I feel like that's not really helping in terms of being able to create that, because I'd still be depedent on commercial charcoal as a fuel source. Plus, I'm not making the barbeque. Though, I could do a campfire situation, but still would be dependent on commercial charcoal or commercial firewood.

    </div><div>
        I guess it's important to talk about what I'm NOT trying to do. It's not important that I be able to create a light bult from its constituent elemental parts, like blowing the glass, creating the filament, and all that. That is the ideal, but it's not that important. What's most important is that I understand the underlying processes behind every system that I am involved in. For example, I thought about creating my own operating system, but at the end of the day, I'm most likely going to make it work with Linux anyways, so why bother? There's no point in reinventing the wheel, when the wheel is going to do the same thing as any other wheel. Maybe some future generation of Stewards will feel it's necessary to physically fabricate CPUs, but it's probably not going to be me.
    </div><div>
        When I started, I genuinely didn't think I was going to be able to do it for the whole 24 hours. I went without power a couple weeks before this and it was so annoying and frustrating, and that was during the day.
    </div><div>
        As soon as I started, I realized without electricity, I wouldn't be able to know what time it is. Thankfully, I still had my grandfather's pocket watch, so I used that. It wasn't completely reliable. At one point, around 6pm or so, it just stopped working. I wound it up but it stopped again shortly after. I had to wind it all the way and it finally continued working. I can't rely on that entirely, so I'll be working on a sun dial and a water clock.
    </div><div>
        I made another exception for thermometers. I get anxiety when I feel really hot and I don't know why. I start to think I might be sick and in this time of covid, I wonder if I might have caught it. Plus, given that I live in the desert, I think it would be nice to know how hot it's going to be at a given time. It didn't get too hot that day. I think it peaked at 88 degrees. For some reason, I didn't really find the heat intolerable until around 8pm. I don't know why. I don't think it was the humidity. I woke up around 2pm and it was at 86, so it didn't even really change that much. Maybe it was just being in 80+ degree temperatures for an extended period of time.
    </div><div>
        I had a bag of old clothes that I had hoped to eventually repurpose into something else. So when this started, I went through it to figure out what I could turn it into. The one rule I had was that I couldn't turn old underwear into new underwear or old shirts into new shirts. It had to be recycled into something new. Unfortuantely, nothing really seemed adequate for what I needed to make, so I decided to order some fabric to make clothes instead. 
    </div><div>
        I made another exception: using the washing machine. In this case though, I'm not using the washing machine for this day, I'm using it to be able to clear off some blankets from my bed. Either way, it's going to go in the washing machine, so it makes no difference if I throw it in now or later. You could make an argument that I'm cheating, but there's almost no situation in which I'm going to wash blankets by hand when another option is available.  
    </div><div>
        Another exception that I'm actually lowkey ashamed of: soda. There's no actual justification for this other than my addiction. This day would be so much more unpleasant if I couldn't drink soda. I might start drinking it unrefrigerated if I reach a point in the process where that's the the only refrigerated item I'm consuming. I'd like to be able to create my own but I drink diet soda so that's a little bit more tricky.

        One insight I had during this test run was that if I had a job, this would make things very difficult. Because I have to withdraw almost entirely from society in order to do this. (I am planning on adding other restrictions like not talking to non-Stewards when that becomes viable.) When I eventually get one, I'll have to just change it to once a week, or change the day to accomodate my work, but Monday will probably always be the restrictive intolerance day. Then I realized this isn't really intended for lay people. Stewardship has always been intended as a Monastic order.

        For the most part, it wasn't really that difficult, but once it reached around 10pm, I was really looking forward to midnight. July 4th wasn't ideal, because I had to have the window open but people kept setting off fireworks for the holiday. I spent most of my day reading and was able to finish off two books.

        The main project I worked on that day and afterwards was making some sandals. The specific type is a <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paduka'>paduka</a> I had some particle board, a dowel and some scrap I was able to make into it. Unfortuantely, it doesn't have the heel and toe like the one in the link. It's just flat. I also didn't shape it like a foot because I figured it wasn't important for testing. I'm writing this entry a few days after July 4th, and I just finished the sandals a couple days ago. They aren't great. They're barely functional. It's not pleasant walking on pieces of wood, obviously. But I'm concerned that I might injure myself by the particle board breaking in half or the dowel breaking and I'm going to stab myself in the foot. So, I'll probably use it only this Monday, but I'm going to try to make a new pair of sandals from rope.

        One exception I never noticed until after I had already done it was tissues. I'm making an exception for toilet paper, because the current alternative is much worse, but with tissues it's relatively trivial to make some hankies. So that's another project.

        One assumption that I made when starting this project is that I would not be able to create my own shelter in order to do this. While doing the test run though, I was in the garage, enjoying a cross breeze between the back door and front door. And I thought, it'd be nice if I could be in a place where it was possible to feel a breeze from all directions. Then I realized all I need is a tent of some kind. This isn't impossible, but there are a LOT of ants in both yards. Just when I was in the garage, I had to keep constant watch of the ants crawling in to make sure they don't bite me. And there's really no great place to set it up in the backyard. If I do set up a tent, I will also have to create a special structure to avoid the ants as well.

        All in all, I think it was a good experience but there were a few different thing I need to make sure I've already done beforehand next time: cover all clocks, clean dishes in the dishwasher, and have my beans already cooked.
