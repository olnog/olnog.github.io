        I didn't have much time before work but I figured a couple hours would be good. Sometimes, when I do this, I get SO BORED, I just take a nap. Which is what I did for about two hours. Most of the time though, I was working on figuring out how to make my own ink. I made my own paper recently and I have enough for about one or two more sessions besides this one. The paper isn't very good. It's rough and I have to use a marker instead of a pen to be able to write consistently. But I was reading this book called 40,000 Years Of Ink (or something like that).

        I downgrade my setup as much as feasibly possibly when I do these sessions to try and replicate a future DIY computer setup. So I have an older style Ubuntu desktop I switch to for these sessions. For ease of use, I just plugged it into the VGA port on my TV but my TV is about a foot or two above my eye line and I don't know if it's because of that, because it's VGA, or because it's a TV but it is exceedingly uncomfortable to try to read digital books from there. Definitely gotta get that fixed.

        A while back, I had created a new system of measuring time which I'm tentatively calling Metric Time. Instead of the system of there ~84,000 seconds per day and 60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day, there would be just 100,000 metric seconds, starting from solar noon. Yesterday, I realized how important it was to start doing that again during this project. 
    </div><div>
        Though, I did realize a short-coming of Metric Time just yesterday as well. Metric Time is based on the solar noon of whereever you happen to be locally. The problem with that is if you're coordinating across just a couple hours  away from each other, there's a time difference. From where I live now and just two hours away, there's a five minute time difference between solar noons. There will actually be two different systems of this metric time though. One is Earth-based which would vary the number of second per day around the literal metric second (So some days would be 100,005. Some more. Some less.) and days would be sequestered in months and years. Then there's universal time which has just a strict 100k cyclical metric second day from a single point and years aren't 365 days. They're either 100 days or 1000 days. And that's it. So, hypothetically, people could coordinate in universal time if they were so inclined.

        One thing I've been having a bit of issue with, emotionally, is that I'm just not making a lot of progress. The first time I started keeping track of Holy Days was June 12th, and I did bits and pieces of progress like a program to keep track of Metric Time but it wasn't until July 22 that I first started using the paper that I had made. Considering the overall scope of the progress, that seems unnecessarily slow, but I also don't have a lot of money to invest in the project. And some of the projects just seem extremely daunting, like a DIY computer. Even the most basic computer seems like a project that is significantly out of my wheelhouse. 
    </div><div>
        There's another aspect which is that I'm only keeping track of things outside of the context that I am in a house, using furniture, using software, and consuming media that is not part of The Organization.
    </div><div>
        So, yeah, I mainly just read about the history of making ink, napped and read one of the books in The Expanse series.
