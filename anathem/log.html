    <div>
        Monasticism: I was just reading a biography about the guy who made paper from wood pulp for the first time and they mentioned Martin Luther and how he was a monk. Considering this whole enterprise is about being a monk, I thought I'd read about him. One thing I never thought about in terms of this whole project is trying to continue these Holy Days past that day. I never saw the utility in it until I read a characterization of the committment of Martin Luther to monastic life and I realized maybe I need to start evaluating another aspect of these days : length of time. I nornmally just do a few hours and call it a day, but maybe I can do this over a few days?
    </div><div>
        TMJ: My TMJ got worse today. Though, I'm not sure why. It got bad yesterday as well around the same time, after eating my middle meal, so I don'tk now if that has something to do with it. Today, though, my jaw started to ache instead of just the normal tightness and I got concerned it was some kind of infection. It's fine now though an hour or two later. I still won't be eating any solid foods for the next month or so. I keep wondering what it could be.
    </div><div>
        Papermaking: So I got all ready to make some paper and I think the paper vat is officially donezo from the last time I made paper which was, if memory serves me correctly, about 150g of shredded paper which netted maybe about 8 relatively small bits of recycled paper. On the biggest one, I could not get hardly any paper onto the mold and the smallest one, I could get some but not enough to cover it sufficiently. I think before I finish today, I'll shred the paper I do have and start looking into what is required for turning rags into paper. (It appears that it's literally just soaking fabric in water.) Because I'm so low, I might start looking into integrating cardboard into the process. I'm definitely not going to be ready to start making it from wood pulp until I get something to shred wood.    There's a shredder from Harbor Freight for 1.5 inches but that seems really, really small to the point of not being useful. I might try it though just for how cheap it is. I found a few used ones online that might not be too bad but I'd probably have to have a truck for that to be viable. 
    </div><div>
        Towel: I strung together about six pairs of socks, side by side and end to end to make a small towel. It was quite laborious to make it but I'm glad I finished. I wished it looked more like a towel than just a bunch of socks sewn together but I think it will suffice for a towel for now.
    </div><div>
        Clothing: I made a shirt really quick because I was feeling good about making a towel. I did some basic measurements on myself but then just decided to make straight lines on the fitted sheet I was using and then fold it in half and use the pattern I had made previously for a robe. It's a little too big in the shoulder but I think that's better than the alternative. Also, it's a little too tight in the thighs when I sit down but overally, it's okay.
    </div><div>
        Metric Time / Programming: I made it to where the programmed solar noon was the default entry for the text field, so I don't have to continually keep looking it up over and over again in the solar noon calculator link. Also made the link open up a new window instead of that window. Created universal time so that I'm not just overly dependent on Earth Metric Time
    </div><div>
        I had an idea for metric time to distinguish in shorthand between Earth and Universal time. e and u are obvious but because I will likely abbreviate the time to 10.1k or 25.1k. I can maybe abbreviate it to 20.5EK or 20.5UK to distinguish between the two succintly. Though, for Universal Time, yeah, 4.4 million days is super unwieldy. Maybe there's another shorthand that can be applied there. The current Universal Date as it is currently calculated is 4,391,859. Maybe everything above 1,000 is just assumed or is in a different frame of reference. So the date is 859 and the context of that date is 4.391 million or 4,391. Not quite as unwieldy. Though, the term for that can't really be year because year has too much semantic baggage. Maybe cycle? 4,391 cycles and 859 days. I don't think days necessarily has the same kind of semantic baggage as year does. For most people, it doesn't necessarily mean the solar day just your biological day. Maybe we can make that distinction clearer by making it a metric day. Actually, let's just try that distinction now in the clock.
    </div><div>
        Holy Day Protocol: I decided that in terms of logging interactions, I no longer need to log things that are related to the infrastructure I am created. So the sewing machine I used today to make clothes, not something I need to log. I used wood glue and some other stuff to make the deckle today. Not necessary to log that. Once I reach the bottom of the infrastructure (not sure if that's the best way to describe it), only then would I focus on being able to make the tools that are used to make the things that I make.
    </div>

    <div>
        I started out working on the clock. Instead of having to update the JS code with solar noon, you can now just set the solar noon on the page. The next steps are to have it automatically do that (not sure if I can do that with client-side javascript) and to be able to convert regular time to metric time. 
    </div><div>
        I've mostly run out of paper that I've created for this project so I have to start making more. Using these sheets made me question why they're not flat and they're kinda crumpled up. I figure it has something to do with how it dried. Maybe I need to leave it under a press for like a week to get all the moisture out. My vat that I've been using for paper had a dead cricket in it and I finally got it out. My Mom also accidentally threw the dryer lint directly into it instead of the box above so we'll see if that had any kind of effect. Also, today, I figured out why the mold and deckle (might be messing up the terms) are two separate pieces. My mold and deckle are all one piece. You dip it in and then you have to kind of tap it against the surface once it's dried a little bit. (I'm using window screen and it goes between two pieces, so it goes under the mold and gets stuck there.) Today, I only waited a half hour instead of the hour or two and it just torn into pieces because it was so wet. But if the mold could come off and I could lay it out flat, I don't think that would have been as much of an issue. I'm working on a new one right now, so we'll see if that's something I can integrate into the process.
    </div><div>
        It's weird that the mold in mold and deckle for papermaking does not refer to the thing that literally molds it into the shape of paper.
    </div><div>
        Last time I did this, I realized that my sheet and pillow are another interaction that I may not have previously logged. So I haev this big bag of socks that my uncle gave me before he died, I thought maybe I could make a blanket out of that but I think I might make a towel instead since they're relatively similar fabric. Socks aren't flat when you cut them so it'll be interesting how I work around that project. I was only able to string together three before the string on the sewing machine broke at the needle. I just hate threading the bobbin on this because its so goddamn difficult.
    </div><div>
        Yeah, I might need a new sewing machine. The string keeps breaking after I rethread the needle. So I think I figured out whatever the issue was with it breakign when I rethreaded the needle. But now it's getting stuck in the bobbin and the bobbin thread broke. 
    </div><div>
        So instead of waiting a half hour to let the paper dry, I waited a full hour. Still tore when I started tapping it to get it loose. I think another contributing factor is there's not as much paper in it, so its a thinner paper than usual. I think I'll have to wait until I complete the new deckle.
    </div><div>
        I feel good that I worked on two different aspects of the project, but I feel bad I didn't really accomplish anythig meaningful, which is how I felt last time. The only progress from last time (outside of learning) was that I finally moved my PC monitor down to the desk so I'm not straining my eyes anymore.
    </div><div>
        I keep thinking about the scope of this project and it just feels so unmanageable. Obviously, it's a huge project, but it feels like progress just never gets made. Maybe I'm not doing it enough and that might be because I'm not getting any success in the process. =(
    </div><div>
        One thing I did have a little bit of insight about though is the importance of previous work, if that makes any kind of sense. I was able to work on making paper and making a towel based on doing it previously.

        July 27, 2024 (12:47 - 15:57)
    </h3><div>
        I didn't have much time before work but I figured a couple hours would be good. Sometimes, when I do this, I get SO BORED, I just take a nap. Which is what I did for about two hours. Most of the time though, I was working on figuring out how to make my own ink. I made my own paper recently and I have enough for about one or two more sessions besides this one. The paper isn't very good. It's rough and I have to use a marker instead of a pen to be able to write consistently. But I was reading this book called 40,000 Years Of Ink (or something like that). 
    </div><div>
        I downgrade my setup as much as feasibly possibly when I do these sessions to try and replicate a future DIY computer setup. So I have an older style Ubuntu desktop I switch to for these sessions. For ease of use, I just plugged it into the VGA port on my TV but my TV is about a foot or two above my eye line and I don't know if it's because of that, because it's VGA, or because it's a TV but it is exceedingly uncomfortable to try to read digital books from there. Definitely gotta get that fixed.
    </div><div>
        A while back, I had created a new system of measuring time which I'm tentatively calling Metric Time. Instead of the system of there ~84,000 seconds per day and 60 seconds per minute, 60 minutes per hour and 24 hours per day, there would be just 100,000 metric seconds, starting from solar noon. Yesterday, I realized how important it was to start doing that again during this project. 
    </div><div>
        Though, I did realize a short-coming of Metric Time just yesterday as well. Metric Time is based on the solar noon of whereever you happen to be locally. The problem with that is if you're coordinating across just a couple hours  away from each other, there's a time difference. From where I live now and just two hours away, there's a five minute time difference between solar noons. There will actually be two different systems of this metric time though. One is Earth-based which would vary the number of second per day around the literal metric second (So some days would be 100,005. Some more. Some less.) and days would be sequestered in months and years. Then there's universal time which has just a strict 100k cyclical metric second day from a single point and years aren't 365 days. They're either 100 days or 1000 days. And that's it. So, hypothetically, people could coordinate in universal time if they were so inclined.
    </div><div>
        One thing I've been having a bit of issue with, emotionally, is that I'm just not making a lot of progress. The first time I started keeping track of Holy Days was June 12th, and I did bits and pieces of progress like a program to keep track of Metric Time but it wasn't until July 22 that I first started using the paper that I had made. Considering the overall scope of the progress, that seems unnecessarily slow, but I also don't have a lot of money to invest in the project. And some of the projects just seem extremely daunting, like a DIY computer. Even the most basic computer seems like a project that is significantly out of my wheelhouse. 
    </div><div>
        There's another aspect which is that I'm only keeping track of things outside of the context that I am in a house, using furniture, using software, and consuming media that is not part of The Organization.
    </div><div>
        So, yeah, I mainly just read about the history of making ink, napped and read one of the books in The Expanse series.
