    I wanted to talk about consumption as a core tenet of our society. It's kind of insidiuous actually, because it's so unquestioned that people take it for granted. I was thinking about it from the consumption of media. Media, in of itself, as a product of industrialization is inherently conumption oriented, but when you think about consumption in general ...

    I guess, this isn't that interesting of a line of thought. Consumption (of media) is consumerism. Or consumption is a consumer activity. That's not really saying anything. 

    But that's the insidious part of it. I'm thinking about it from the perspective of a society that is not oriented  towards consumption. Me and my family spend almost every waking moment at home awash in media. If I'm not watching TV, I'm listening to musci and/or playing video games. This media is mostly distributed and created as part of a market process, to seek profit. That is its only value. An exceptionally great media series will be cancelled, not because they weren't great, but because they weren't profitable enough. But a lot of media is able to be created and distributed because there's a lot of money being put behind it. And like I said, people are incentivized because of profit.

    But what if I didn't live in a society like that? People would make media because they wanted to. Even if it doesn't make money. And I probably wouldn't consume media like I do because it honestly probably wouldn't be that good for the most part. If everyone is making media, the truly great media will probably be few and far between, but there
