    <div>
        I've always had a kind of laissez faire attitude about work. The Protestant Work Ethic is for puritans. I believe in allowing for things to arrive naturally at their conclusion. 
    </div><div>
        The problem with that is that capitalists will work every day, all day for profit. They will abandon their children, their families in order to 'provide for their family'.
    </div><div>
        This whole system of belief is centered around an economic problem: compelled labor. When I first started working on the theoretical frrameworks of what would eventually become The White Tigers, the idea was that we would provide for humanity. Without reservation. Without expectating anything in return. It was the only way to arrive at a post-scarcity future. 
    </div><div>
        Compromises would have to have been made. The White Tigers would provide for everyone but only if people were willing to follow certain relatively benign rules. I realized though, that there is no way to enforce rules on people who are not part of your social group in a way that does not make it compulsory. So I gave up on that lofty goal and focus merely on the idea of a community devoted to the ideals that it's based on.
    </div><div>
        A capitalist will work every day and all day until they die and if I'm not willing to enforce some kind of minimum number of hours to work(at least for myself), they will win. Every single time. 

    </div><div>
        40 hours a week converted to metric time is 167kT. (I'm trying this new thing where I add T to the end of k so that it becomes a little less ambiguous.) Divide that by 7 and that's 24kT per day. So a minimum of 25kT per day and 250kT per every ten day cycle. Even for The White Tigers, this wouldn't (or at least shouldn't) be enforced but it would be seen as a moral failing to not do 25kT or 250kT for every ten days. 
    </div><div>
        This is just what's required to even be considered as playing the same game as capitalists.
