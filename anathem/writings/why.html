        Extreme opinions require extreme choices and asking other people to engage in it with me requires an extreme commitment. 
    </div><div>
        I live in a society that disgusts me. A pandemic that kills a million of its citizens and one of its first priorities was getting back to work. People that live on the streets are scapegoated as vermin and leeches. People that die for no other reason than they cannot afford medical care or they fear medical bankruptcy. 
    </div><div>
        Even on an individual level, I've never felt personally fulfilled by the expectations of society. Go to school. Get a good job. If I go to school, I will rack up an exorbitant amount of debt and even if I did go to school with that premise, I don't find fulfillment in climbing the corporate ladder.
    </div><div>
        A central principle of our society (because of how it is structured) is that no matter how much you have and/or make, you will always want more. Get a higher paying job? A year later, you'll want an even better job. Save a million dollars. Well, what if you saved ten million dollars? And, yes, life is a hedonistic treadmill, but there comes a point in your life where all of the consumption and all of the working won't fill the hole in your soul. Maybe if you're lucky, you'll be running so fast on the treadmill, you won't notice, but if you ever do, I hope it's not too painful.

        I've been a minimalist my entire adult life. I've always aspired to live at the poverty level.

        I guess I should talk about the why. That was one of the first things my friend asked me when I told him I started living like this. 
    </div><div>
        To escape capitalism. 
    </div><div>        
        Capitalism exists and thrives for two reasons. Say, a million people were born randomly out in the world. A capitalist society can easily integrate those million people because that's a million more people to their labor force. But what about the people that don't get jobs? Those will bring down society. No, they won't because a capitalist society doesn't care about human beings. It only cares about labor, and the production and consumption of that labor. If they don't work, they won't be able to survive. Their deaths will be capitalism's profit. Their incarceration will be capitalism's profit. Whether or not you seek to be a part of the capitalist system, the capitalist system will be able to profit off of you. That is its strength.
    </div><div>        
        Whether or not profit was obtained morally is an irrelvant thing to the capitalist. This is the second reason. A capitalist can burn a rainforest down to create a palm plantation and this is good because it creates jobs. The ecodiversity that was sacrificed or the indigenous people that were displaced/murdered are merely an unintended side effect. Whether you fired an entire generation of workers or hired a hit squad to murder locals, at the end of the day, that's just good business. Smart business. And, yes, there may be some negative externalities but nothing a good PR campaign, a name change or a philanthropic campaign won't fix. This is the capitalist.        
    </div><div>
        I live in a society where the idea of providing food and shelter to people is considered controversial. Do they deserve it? Did they work hard enough? Are they disabled? Fuck you. Everyone deserves food and shelter. 
    </div><div>
        In the society that I live, you can die because you don't have enough money for adequate healthcare. And people will say that's very sad, but that person should have lived a healthier lifestyle or worked harder because their tax dollars shouldn't have to pay for someone else's healthcare. Fuck you. Everyone deserves healthcare.
    </div><div>
        You escape capitalism by not being a part of it. You reduce your exposure to it. Your consumption. Your labor. 
    </div><div>
        Some people will say that's impossible. And maybe so. Maybe there will always be things that capitalism provides that cannot be produced in any other economic system. But you can still reduce your consumption and reduce your labor. I'm not advocating for some granola, back-to-the-land, peace and love lifestyle. Just purely reducing your consumption and reducing your labor.
    </div><div>
        Some people will say, "Yeah, I can reduce my consumption. That's easy! But reduce my labor? I got bills to pay!" Then you're not reducing your consumption. People wil go out of their way to say how easy it is to reduce their consumption and then not do it.
    </div><div>
        Oftentimes, when I've talked about this, people have said, "oh, man, I couldn't not work. I'd be so bored!" In other words, "It's really fun for me to be exploited by capitalists or to cosplay as one." You reduce your labor that can be exploited by capitalists so that you can use that labor for your community or for yourself.

    </div><div>
        You might view me as an extremist who would go out of their way not to consume. In my mind, the only consumption you should be doing is out of necessity (and really, really think about what the word necessity means because consumers under a capitalist society have very little idea what necessity means) or in a way that is emotionally gratifying.
    </div><div>
        I just paid for my hair to be styled a couple weeks ago. By my standards, that's a little gratituitous. But I've been wanting cornrows for -years-. At least 14 years. So even though it was a consumer activity, (atleast how I'm able to access it) to finally have that experience was emotionally gratifying.
    </div><div>
        That is a trap though. There's a difference between something being emotionally gratifying and just feeling nice. I have a work event where we're supposed to wear sneakers. None of my sneakers are fashion oriented and the only sneakers that I am interested in having are extremely rare $200 sneakers from around 2008. That's gratituitous and I can't even find them in my size. So then I started looking up other sneakers. Outside of some traditional chucks, there are no sneakers that I'm interested in that aren't exceedingly expensive. (The original Jordans are selling for as high as $70k) But I kept looking. Seeing if I could find anything. I don't own any sneakers that are acceptable fashion accessories. And because this event mentions sneakers, I thought I should buy some. But that's the trap. The benign social expectation. The lingering, nascent desire. Now I'm back to consuming needlessly. I'll just wear my dress shoes that I've had for ten years.
