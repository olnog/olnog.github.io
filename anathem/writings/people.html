    <h3 id='' class="center">The Problem of More People</h3>
    <div>
        I am not optimistic about being able to create a social organization. One thing that I've learned about myself is that due to my neurodivergence, I have almost no ability to predict the behavior of other people. This isn't to say that I am completely without social skills or social insight or whatever. Just the narrating that neurotypical people take for granted isn't accessible to me without considerable effort. And this lifestyle that I'm engaging in is already kind of a hard sell in general.

        I am COVID cautious. Hyper vigilant. Whatever term you want to use, I don't view casual exposure to COVID and other viral contaminants as a necessary and acceptable every day occurence. In some hypothetical world where I was able to convince people to join me in my pursuit, I'm concerned that the larger the organization became, the more likely I would be exposed to disease needlessly. That in of itself doesn't bother me as much as: there's not really anything I can do about it. These people will be living and eating with me. I have no problem wearing a mask while working but wearing it -all the time- seems like a bit much for me. And even then, I plan on creating communal sleeping quarters so why would I mask all day and then sleep in a room with possible infection vectors?

        There's this moral fallacy that was pretty common at the height of the pandemic. People would view contracting COVID as a moral failing. They didn't contract COVID as merely something that happened to them in their day to day life but as a deliberate moral failing. They weren't careful enough. They were careless. They were reckless with their own health and the health of the immunocompromised people in their life.

        I don't like that type of thinking. It's the kind of superior elitism that plagues circles on the left that I can't stand. Now, if that person is anti-vaccine and hostile to masking, that's an entirely different thing. But if they've taken reasonable precautions and lapsed, that's fine. Though, I think the problem in our society is that taking basic precautions like masks and vaccines has become so weaponized by conservatives in our society that non-political people have started leaning that way. 
    </div><div>
        This is all hypothetical. I've been doing this work for about half a year now and haven't really communicated it to anyone outside of this website. The few people I do tell it to genuinely don't understand what I am doing. And even I know that this is an extreme lifestyle that only a few extreme people will be cut out for. I guess, at the end of the day, especially in the context of the fact that I assume that it will never be more than me doing this, The Problem of More People is one of them good problems.
