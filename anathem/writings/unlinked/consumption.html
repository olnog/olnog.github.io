    I want to imagine what life would be like without compulsive consumption. You may have heard the term 'conspicuous consumption' which means to buy and use goods and services as a means to shows your social status. Compulsive consumption is consumption for the sake of consumption.

    People in our society react to the slightest inconvience with consumption. I try to repair my clothes. Repair my shoes. Everyone I know thinks that's stupid. "Why don't you just buy a new one?" Why are we so dependent on that? Part of it is emotional. People don't want to be frustrated and some people have almost no capacity for frustration.

    A while back, I thought the toilet might be leaking but I wasn't sure. There was drops of water near it but not enough for there to be a leak that would be worrisome. Almost an inexplicable amount like I wasn't sure why. I figured the best thing to do was just keep an eye and see how it develops. I communicated this to my mother (who owns the house) and she immediately called someone out to fix it. Even after I told her I wasn't sure if it was actually leaking. She refused, saying that it needs to be taken care of right away. A short while later, I realized that while I was doing something in the bathroom, a container that contained a small amount of liquid had fallen in that same spot and I had forgotten all about it. My mom was livid because she had already called for someone and now she had to cancel.

    Another part of compulsive consumption is conspicuous consumption but no so much in the sense of keeping up with the joneses but not being lumped in with the cletuses of the world. "That's ghetto." they say at someone attempting to repair their clothes or shoes, especially if it's not done in an immaculately professional way. (How does one become an immaculate professional if not through a process of not being one?)

    Part of it is classist. To be seen as lower class is to be seen as less than, even if that's what you literally are. Capitalism keeps winnning because inconvenience can be resolved if you have the money. But life is inconvenient. You can try but you can't buy your way a better way of living. A better lifestyle maybe. But we're all living with the capacities we have.
