    I want to explicitly divorce myself, the monastery and any movement associated with me and my writings from hippies and in general, the back to nature movement.

    When I talk about the divinity of land, it is not the divinity of nature. Land is not sacred because it is nature and the spirit of the universe or whatever. Land is sacred because it is history. Not of history. But it is history itself. 

    If the monastery becomes a thing and continues into the future, it continues from a point in history that is tied to a specific point in space, which is land. 

    Maybe I'm just making rationalizations though. My mother was a Navy brat and lived in multiple locations through her childhood and while I didn't live in nearly as many places as she did, I lived in more places than I would have liked. All of the places from my childhood don't exist. The stores and restaurants I frequented no longer exist. The parks I played in don't have the same playgrounds. The only place that has remained relatively the same and is still accessible to me is my grandmother's house. And one of the greatest pains that I will ever experience is when she dies and her children sell the house and some randos will be living there. Half a century of history and legacy erased and forgotten as soon as I die.

    The spaces that we inhabit have a little bit of sacredness and somtimes, a lot. But the sacredness of these spaces does not come from nature.
