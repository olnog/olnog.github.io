    I'm kind of stumbing along right now when it comes to creating things for The Divinity of Infrastructure. I had originally intended this to be a hierarchy of creation but it ended up being more about specifying the aspects of creation. I think this is just as good. It's more about spelling out what I'm unable to put in words.

    Simplification
    When you are unable to create something, you can simplify the thing itself down to its constituent components or simplify the process itself.

    Manifestation
    You created the thing. Maybe it's not the ideal thing but it's something you created and that is divine. When manifesting, there's quantity and quality. As you progress, you want to manifest a greater quantity or quality.

    Automation
    The ultimate goal of the monastery is to create everything in an automated fashion with no human intervention, but this will probably be done piecemeal. One small step in the process at a time. But the day when everything is automated is something great.

    One thing I've kind of been stumbling on is that I'm so anti-capitalist, anti-consumption, I've been overly focused on recycling things to create the things that I want. This is necessary but it can be a stumbling block in of itself. (though, procrastination is really the root cause ultimately)

    To be more specific, I need blankets. I saved all my old clothes and I had planned one using them one day. I have a pile of socks that I have cut specifically for a blanket but the labor required is just so intensive, I keep putting it off over and over again. But, I can honestly just go get the required fabric for this and use that instead. 

    I think when engaging in acts of creation for The Discipline, it's important to spell out the resources that are required so that can be the next step in this process.
