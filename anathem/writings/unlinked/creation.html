    I wanna talk about aspects of creation. Creation is what all White Tigers aspire to because it is only through creation that we can elevate ourself and humanity. In order to talk about aspects of creation, I will use the example of paper.

    Creation seems like a simple thing. You make a piece of paper. This is creation. 

    If you remember, we use the word exalted to describe something that has been created as part of The Discipline. Once something has been created, that's not the end. It's not enough for something to be created. The entire process of creation should be exalted. So while you were able to convert wood pulp or rags to paper, did you create the wood pulp yourself? Are the rags from when you were creating clothing? Were the tools you used to make paper also created as part of that? This is the highest aspirating of the White Tigers: for every aspect of creation to be exalted.

    Capitalists can afford waste. Surplus capital allows them to ignore negative externalities because the net result of production will ultimately be positive if the end goal is profit. White Tigers cannot afford to waste anything. While a capitalist aspires to ascend to a station in life to where they can completely ignore all negative externalities, a White Tiger can thrive in the capitalists' garbage because nothing is wasted. How things can be recycled should always be considered when created.

    A capitalist is laways looking to market the newest, shiniest thing. They feel embarassed about not owning the newest shiniest gadget because it makes them aware of their station. We simplify and devolve. We could use the newest, hottest gaming PC or we could simplify and use the raspberry pi equivalent of a 20 year old computer. Maybe, we take it even further and instead of using a computer at all, we devolve completely to more primitive equivalents of the technology. Write in a word processor? Why not write it on paper? 

    A capitalist loves automation. With automation, they can fire workers and replace them with machines - if it's profitable to do so. We also love automation, but only because it means we can spend time on something else. Even when we've accomplished everything, when we've had the entire process be exalted, and have no waste, we must also aspire to not have to personally do it ourselves.
