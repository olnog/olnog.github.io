        Making decisions within an organization is a messy and bureaucratic thing. Normally decision-making is streamlined through authority, but since we are focusing more on egalitarian solutions, the ideal form of decision making will be unanimous voting.         
    </div><div>
        Unanimous voting is slow though and there will almost always be disagreement. So, what I figured was we could assign people 'domains' (areas in which they are considered an authority) but they still need a majority decision to ratify major decisions. But they have authority within a certain subset of actions to act unilaterally without anyone's input.
    </div><div>
        Anyone can formally petition a domain authority for a particular action and it is at an authority's discretion if and how they respond to it. Ultimately, an authority can censure someone if they feel someone is constantly petitioning them. An authority is removed and granted unanimously unless the monastery authority (someone's whose authority is the monastery) or that authority who is the subject themselves grants a majority vote from a petition.

        Major decisions that affect everyone and will potentially have far reaching consequences will have to be unanimous.
