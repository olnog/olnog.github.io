    <h3 id='' class="center">Helping People</h3>
    <div>
        I had this idea a while back and I just thought I would write it down. I want to be able to help people. That is what our organization is all about. Helping people is the entire purpose of community. The problem is that capitalism is inherently antagonistic to community when the profit motive is involved. That guy at the gas station asking for money for gas? He could be someone who needs help or he could just be a scammer. That person asking for a ride to their house? They might just be doing that so they can rob you or hurt you. Helping random people is idealistically wonderful but realistically dangerous. 
    </div><div>
        So that kind of just leaves people who are in your circle. The problem with that is that most people in your social circle are in your social circle because they are under similar circumstances.
    </div><div>
        My solution was to create a website or app where people can go to fill out a form to request help. They'd write their name, contact info, a description of the kind of help they're looking to receive and whether they want this to be confidential. This wouldn't necessarily be a text box for the description, they could also leave an audio recording or a video whatever is easier for them. 
    </div><div>
        These requests could then be evaluated properly instead of having to do it on the spur of the moment for most requests. Additionally, the request page itself could act as a log of all the other previous help attempts both as a way of letting people know how we can help them but also as a way of letting them know how we cannot help them.
    </div><div>
        Confidential requests would be still be logged but there would be a random time (10-100 days) that it would be delayed before posting and the details of the request would be sufficiently abstracted for that person's privacy. The person may deny the intiial description of the event up to three times with each request being processed by an AI Agent to further abstract it. People have up to ten days to respond to these approval request before they are posted.     
    </div><div>
        Now I realize that's a very bureaucratic and inhuman way of helping people, so alternatively, every monastery should have a bell with a sign for people to ring it if they need help. I feel like I'm really going to regret that concept in terms of the level of intrusion it represents, but helping people is central to this idea.
