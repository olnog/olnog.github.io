      I've been thinking about security lately. The place where I will buy my first land will have a huge amount of crime. I expect that people will constantly be trespassing and stealing stuff for years until I can get a more consistent presence on it.

      This made me think, 'what does that mean for the monastery?' Ideally, we'd be pacificists and never have to engage in violence or even involve LEO for issues. But we also can't be victims over and over again and not do anything. 
    </div><div>
      Capitalists enforce their hoarding of capital through force so in principle, we wouldn't want to have to physically fight people for resources and infrastructure, but we can't become victims of them as well.
    </div><div>
      There is a tendency for Communists and Anarchists (in America) to view pacificism as the only reasonable route to take. But if capitalists enforce their hoarding through force (and the legitimization of that use of force), what's pacificism going to do besides make you a victim?     
    </div><div>
      I think that the American Left has taken this ideal to a degree that's made them completely toothless and seeking out to become a victim so they can feel even more self-righteous. And that works if you expose the other party as inherently evil. But if that other side thinks -you- are inherently evil, that doesn't really mean anything. The American Right can pretty much explain anyway almost any act of violence with, "Those were Communists/BLM/Satanists/child molestors." or just deny entirely the perpetrator is acting from a conservative context entirely. "The shooter had a nose ring. Does that sound like a conservative?"
    </div><div>
      As much as Americans decry the constant surveillance of China, (like America doesn't engage in constant surveillance as well) every-vigilant surveillance is extremely important for protecting the monastery. If someone steals from us, it's not enough to document it. It needs to be documented in triplicate. Then that person needs to be identified. 
    </div><div>
      We need a system for keeping track of people. Profiteers. People who would take from us under the guise of help and flip it for profit. People who would steal from us for money. We need to be hyper-connected. Everything we do, everything we interact with (specifically when outside of the monastery) should be recorded and analyzed. Maybe we'll see the car of the person who stole from us at their house. Maybe we'll interact with them because they're working at a store.
