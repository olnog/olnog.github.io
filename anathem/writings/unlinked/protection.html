    I've been thinking about security lately. The place where I will buy my first land will have a huge amount of crime. I expect that people will constantly be trespassing and stealing stuff for years until I can get a more consistent presence on it.

    This made me think, 'what does that mean for the monastery?' Ideally, we'd be pacificists and never have to engage in violence or even involve LEO for issues. But we can't be victims over and over again and not do anything. 

    Capitalists enforce their hoarding of capital through force so in principle, we wouldn't want to have to physically fight people for resources and infrastructure, but we can't become victims of them as well.
