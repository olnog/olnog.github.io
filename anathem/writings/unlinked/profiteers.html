        Operating in a capitalist world, where profiteers abound, how do you freely distribute things of need without becoming victim to the profit mentality? Until we have our own sovereignty, we are always under siege.
    </div><div>
        The initial focus for distribution should starts with the surs and fraas within the monastery. The next step is monasteries/organizations we trade with. After that, it's the community who we provide for. And after that, it is people who are not part of our community but who we wish to help. (as long as they are not profiteers)
    </div><div>
        We cannot operate within a vaccuum. Capitalists go forth into the world and try to sell any and everyhing they can. We must try to be of use in order to compete with them, but where they are competing for money, we are competing for hearts and minds. But unlike capitalists, we are not transactional. We aren't doing it for the hearts and minds. We are doing it to help people. At a hyper local level, we can do that. 
    </div><div>
        The distinction between distributing to those within our community and those outside of our community is that people within our community are able to come to us to get resources from us. Those outside of the community must wait until we bring it to them. (This is not to say that people within our community aren't able to have us bring it to them, but people outside of our community cannot do so without making a special request.)
    </div><div>
        Additionally, distribution outside of our community is reserved for surplus. We have inventory that we must maintain as part of our production. We will inevitably (and hopefully) surpass our storage and start to go into surplus. We can calculate out how much we can afford to give out to the general public and have giveaways for these items if they are interested. 
    </div><div>
        Alternatively, if conditions allow for it, , we can sell it as part of our online business. Not entirely for profit but just for operational funds. (we still live in a capitalist society.)

    <!--
        AI talks about the hazard of commodification of resources in regards to selling the surplus. 
        the hiearchaical nature of it may be prone to elitisim and there's also a concern for resource shortages in regards to members of the communtiy imapcing negatively (but this is resolved by the production imperative)
        enforcing dependency - we are saviors and they are needy - mitgated by the ' you deserve it' adage
        sellign the surplus, in general, can lead to it being a business and capitalism in general. (where is the line?)
