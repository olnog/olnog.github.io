    The underlying assumption behind this organization has always been that there is no room for laity. Everyone who is a part of the organization must be completely devoted. One thing that I've been thinking about for quite a while is a distributed ledger as a means of facilitating trade between individuals. A way to transcend the vagaries of barter but more importantly to avoid the freeloader problem with this kind of society. 

    </div><div>
        Obviously, the term freeloader is already kind of loaded especially in the context of American society where they overexaggerate the effect of social services. But my main concern is the inverse problem of so-called capitalist freeloaders. People taking our resouces for the sake of profit.
    </div><div>
        That's what this distributed ledger would help with. Unlike Bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general, where a new coin is generated algorithmically, we would just use it purely as a ledger of record to keep track of transactions across a social network of actors we might not necessarily know personally. 
    </div><div>
        Say, two monasteries have different resouces and they want to trade. Monastery A has logs that Monastery B could use. Monastery B pays X amount of credit to Monastery A for the logs. Now Monastery B gets deducted (possibly going in the negative but maybe not) and Monastery A gets their account increased with the record of the transaction publicly available. 
    </div><div>
        Up until now, I didn't really see in a point in implementing it because it creates a kind of transactional relationship between both entities with both groups inherently keeping score. For what I'm currently trying to achieve and with the cultural goals of the overal organization, that's not really adding any benefit.
    </div><div>
        But I was thinking today about casual people's involvement in The Organization. They don't need to be a part of The Discipline. They can just take and give resources as part of this system. Say, a casual person needs paper, they can just come get it and pay whatever the price is out of their account, but, say, they're giving us a particular thing, they would be debited into their account from the organization. This would lay people to be part of the ongoing effort without being confined to The Discipline. 
    </div><div>
        I've always wondered how to formalize relationships between monasteries. Say two monasteries have a relationship and they were allies but then they differ on a key opinion and decide to no longer be in contact with each other. Like, you could make formal political-esque statements on your websites, but that's a bit bureacratic. This ledger system allows for a more formal system with an intrinsinc value to it. It allows for a quantification of the relationship between the two entities. 
    </div><div>
        Another aspect that's very, very difficult is pricing. The market system resolves that through supply and demand, but these are highly specialized markets with not a lot of actors, how do you figure out the price? Technocracy.
    </div><div>
        A while back, there was a philsophical system called Technocracy that proposed pricing based on the energy required to produce it. I think that's an absolutely fabulous way of characterizing it and egalitarian af.
