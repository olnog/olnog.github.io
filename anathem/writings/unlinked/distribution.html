        I've been thinking about distribution as part of the ledger system I've previously talked about. To give a brief rundown, it'd be a block-chain-esque ledger that would keep track of the actors in the economic system. Instead of like a crypto currency, it would literally just be a ledger. 

        Now some finer points that I never really figured out until now. This distribution system helps resolve profiteers because each person in the system would be biometrically encoded with fingerprint recognition and facial recognition as a central part of accessing the system. And since it's tied to a physical identity, as a person accrues more debt, they would be marked out by the system, and someone within the bottom x% would simply be ineligble for further transactions because they are considered freeloaders. They wouldn't be locked out forever, because as more and more people join, hopefully that number would get bigger and someone who was preivously in the bottom 1% is now only in the top 11%.

        Now the hard part was always pricing and enforcement. Individuals can't be trusted to set prices. Individuals can't be trusted to abide by prices to not inflate their own contributions to the system. (Saying they gave 1,000 of something to someone to get the credit and that person didn't.) 

        The solution is that the monasteries are the communist equivalent of markets. They distribute things to the people but they also enforce the transactions within that economic system. So, while it's theoretically possible for two individuals to create a transaction, a trusted figure within the network would have to oversee that transaction to vouch for it. 

        It does create difficulties for impromptu transactions. They basically don't exist unless they are abiding by the preset pricing set forth by the system. Additionally, there would have to be layers of systems to calculate the pricing for things. 

        Maybe not everything has to have prices manually set. Maybe two individuals who agree on a price can set the baseline for a particular good or service and that helps reflect the price later on for other things. The hard thing is just categorizing/collating every good and service. And there's also the very real dilemna of people who can be trusted who don't have the skill, experience or ability to discern what they are looking at to accurately assees the good or service they're attempting to authorize.

        We could also create a separate category for unverified transactions in those situations. Unverified in the sense that they didn't take place at a monastery at all with no supervision. Unverified because the trusted agent was not able to accurately assess the thing in question. Things like that. 

        That way people whose only positive contributions are all completely unverified makes them suspect and would ultimately still make them up on the bottom 10%.

        And on a similar vein, this system as it got bigger and bigger and more complex is what could potentially create a post-scarcity system. Because as more and more actors came in and more people accrued debt, the debt could become so huge as to make functionally equivalent to post-scarcity.
