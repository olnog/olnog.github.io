        A while back, I read something that basically boiled down to participation in a community is annoying but that's the price you pay to be a part of collective action. What they're saying is that interacting and negotiating with people is annoying but that's the price you to be a part of something. I felt like that was a bit uncharitable. Even for someone as antisocial as I am. I don't think it's right to characterize it as 'annoying'. It's more inconvenient. It's not always convenient to have to make accommodations for other pople. To have to talk to people when you could just be by yourself.

        But convenience is what capitalism offers. That's what capitalism is based on. Built on. Convenience. You don't need to inconvenience yourself with details, learning, collaborating, or working. If you have money, someone in the free market will save you that inconvenience.

        The inconvenience of community is its obligation. I as an individual am obligated to my community for how they help provide for me just as my community has an obligation to provide for me. And my community has an obligation to the communities it trades with to become the best trade partnerrs possible.
