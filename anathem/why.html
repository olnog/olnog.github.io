        I guess I should talk about the why. That was one of the first things my friend asked me when I told him I started living like this. 
    </div><div>
        To escape capitalism. 
    </div><div>        
        Capitalism exists and thrives for two reasons. Say, a million people were born randomly out in the world. A capitalist society can easily integrate those million people because that's a million more people to their labor force. But what about the people that don't get jobs? Those will bring down society. No, they won't because a capitalist society doesn't care about human beings. It only cares about labor and the production and consumption of that labor. If they don't work, they won't be able to survive. Their deaths will be capitalism's profit. Their incarceration will be capitalism's profit. Whether or not you seek to be a part of the capitalist system, the capitalist system will be able to profit off of you.
    </div><div>        
        Whether or not profit was obtained morally is an irrelvant thing to the capitalist. This is the second reason. A capitalist can burn a rainforest down to create a palm plantation and this is good because it creates jobs. The ecodiversity that was sacrificed or the indigenous people that were displaced/murdered are merely an unintended side effect. Whether you fired an entire generation of workers or hired a hit squad to murder locals, at the end of the day, that's just good business. Smart business. And, yes, there may be some negative externalities but nothing a good PR campaign, a name change or a philanthropic campaign won't fix. This is the capitalist.        
    </div><div>
        I live in a society where the idea of providing food and shelter to people is considered controversial. Do they deserve it? Did they work hard enough? Are they disabled? Fuck you. Everyone deserves food and shelter. 
    </div><div>
        In my society, you can die because you don't have enough money for adequate healthcare. And people will say that's very sad, but that person should have lived a more healthy lifestyle or worked harder because their tax dollars shouldn't have to pay for someone else's healthcare. Fuck you. Everyone deserves healthcare.
    </div><div>
        You escape capitalism by not being a part of it. You reduce your exposure to it. Your consumption. Your labor.
    </div><div>
        Some people will say that's impossible. And maybe so. Maybe there will always be things that capitalism provides that cannot be produced in any other economic system. But you can still reduce your consumption and reduce your labor. Now I'm not advocating for some granola, back-to-the-land, peace and love lifestyle. Just purely reducing your consumption and reducing your labor.
    </div><div>
        Some people will say, "Yeah, I can reduce my consumption. That's easy! But reduce my labor? I got bills to pay!" Then you're not reducing your consumption. In the old days, people would throw trash on the ground. (Maybe they still do in some parts.) The idea was that, yeah, trash should go in a trash can but if there's no trash can, what am I supposed to do? Carry my trash around? What am I? A trash man? That's basically the same argument for anyone asking about reducing their labor.
