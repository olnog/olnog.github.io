        originally, I wanted to organize this as something kind of like a to do list, but I'm going to hit the reset button on that. This is more like a way to organize my thoughts on tech. i think the number one rule is taht I cannot put ideas to research, only concrete things to accomplish. And more importantly, there can only be one.

    <h3>cell phone</h3>
    <div>this will have considerable overlap with the computer section. the only real difference is that it will have a touchscreen, a battery and be compact enough to carry it with me. (it can be like a pipboy if I can't make it small enough to fit in my pocket.)</div>
    <div>
        [4391-640] <span class='todo'>make a primitive tablet from a raspberry pi zero</span> according to <a href="https://osm3000.wordpress.com/2022/04/13/building-my-own-tablet/">this link</a>, this seems like it might be easier than what I assumed
    </div>
    <h3>computer</h3>
        <div>
            this is a complex project that will take me -years- to accomplish. the end result will eventually be building a primitive computer like Steve Wozniak did with the first Apple. Something basic and usable like the Altair.

            [4391-640] <span class="todo">run my computing setup off of a raspberry pi</span>
        </div>
    <h3>paper</h3>
    <div>
        [4391-640] <span id='todo'>make new frame.</span> I need to restaple a new screen on the old frame so that I have that one, but I also need to create a new one that's better made. I was thinking of one made out of dowels.
