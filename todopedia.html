    <h1>todopedia</h1>
    <div>
        I guess I can just call it todopedia. (todo means all in spanish.)
    </div><div>
        <b>entries:</b> all the shit that's written, probably eventually have a fucking markup language so people can dynamically put in images and videos but just plain text to start
    </div><div>
        <b> tags: </b> all of the semantic information that's relevant to the information being presented in the entries and is being collected as part of a larger aggregate. a 'tag' as its intiially being conceptualized will probably just be 64 character string to start with but the difficulty within this system of an entry and a tag is how to contextualize the tags. presumably, there would be more than one tag with the same name. 'Britney Spears' could reference the 90s pop singer but it could also reference a hypothetical accountant from Oklahoma. (don't ask me why Britney Spears is always my go-to for this example) every entry should be tagged as much as possible.  to be explicit, there are three aspects to a tag: its name, its relevant entry, and the relevant part (highlighted) of the entry as it relates to the tag OR the entire entry. So I guess there are two types of tag: subject tags and context tags. Each entry can have only one subject tag but as many context tags that are necessary.
    </div><div>
        <b>votes: </b> people can vote on entries and tags. if you're voting on an entry, you're voting on its worth as a piece of writing (presumably as it pertains to the subject tagged) and when  you vote on a tag, you're voting on its relevance to the context.
    </div><div>
        <b>users: </b> i would probably just do this in the most barebones simplest way possible just to force users to only vote once but it seems like kind of a waste to create a user system and not make it part of a larger thing
    </div>
