THe main premise of the game is that you're a spaceship and you can build stuff in space or you can build it on your spaceship. The problem is that as you improve your spaceship, it creates more mass and makes it more expensive to propel through space.



acceleration = force (newtons) / mass (grams)

final speed (m/s) = acceleration * time

thrust formula 
    with the assumption of 5kw of power
    exhaust velocity of hyrogen is 40,000 (m/s)
    mass flow rate = (2 * 5,000 watts) / (40,000^2)
    force (newtons) = mass flow rate (kg/s) * exhaust velocity (m/s)

standard gravity is 9.80665 m/s2
    3g = 29.41995
    6g = 58.8399


58.8399 * 5,000,000,0000 = 294.3 million newtons

294.3millions newtons / 40,0000 = 7357.5 (mass flow rate)

7357.5 * 1600000000 = 

5.886×10¹²


To traverse an AU should take a minute. Let's assume a minute equals one week of time.
    That would be 1.64 m/s^2
    That means I would need to achieve 164k newtons = 1.64 m/s^2 * 1 million kg

How do I deal with the vagaries of acceleration?
    Okay, let's make it to where a player can choose traversal speed as: slow, normal, fast.

Nuclear reactor 10kg, 10mw
    10kg of water
    3kg of nuclear fuel

For one week of thrust for an ion thruster with a 10mw reactor, it would require 10k kg of xenon / 19,000 liter. 
    ion thruster was 100k kg
    -we'll have to call a mulligan and just make it easier to get more xenon while also giving more to the player. 100k kg / 200k liter


Reactor + fuel + water	25,000
Ion thruster system	100,000
Xenon propellant	100,000
Structure & hull	35,000
Avionics, RCS, Batteries, Misc	10,000

It can last 72 days of thrust. After one week, it'll have travelled only .002 AU.

Assuming that you coast, it would take one year to travel 1 AU.
