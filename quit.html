    <h1>quit list</h1>

        I have ADHD. I get bored easily and quit things. I already keep track of why I quit video games, but I figured I'd share that publicly and start keepign track of why I quit other media too. Now I might stop consuming a particular media but it doesn't mean I reject it.

        Honestly, I didn't care and the dialogue in it just felt a little cringe and hokey. It was odd because a lot of old movies that are critically acclaimed, even the bad ones sometimes, I don't mind the writing but this dialogue just felt very unnatural and stilted.

            I just don't really care tbh. I was about to start these seasons up before my  AMC+ subscription expires and I'm just not invested in either of these stories like the original or Fear The Walking Dead.

            I just didn't care. That one naked guy was interesting enough to keep me going for a few more minnutes though.

        It's in Japanese, which isn't a huge dealbreaker, but I was planning on watching it in the background -and- I don't really care what's about to happen in the first few minutes of the movie.

            After I saved Juan, the escort back to the camp was just tso boring I didn't care anymore. This is the 2nd time I've quit this game. The first time was when there was some kind of bug on one of the boxes in army camp that wouldn't let me open them.
