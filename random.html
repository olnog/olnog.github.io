        <b>streaming services / ads:</b> I live in poverty. Because of that, I always go the cheapest route for everything. Even though, I have more than enough money. I aspire to take the bus to work despite it being a huge inconvenience time-wise because it saves me $6. But, for a lot of streaming services, (it really depends on the specific service) it's not worth it to do that because the ad experience is so annoying when binging. AMC Plus is genuinely annoying in this regard. Prime, not some bad, not horrible. But considering that I only sign up for most services for one month at a time, it's not worth my time to not spend the extra $5-10 to not be inundated with ads.
      </div><div>        
        <b>AMC+:</b> Apparently, you can't unsubscribe from AMC Plus from the website. WTF! I cannot stand services that try to play this okey dokey type bullshit. The last service that did something similar was GameFly, where you get NO GRACE PERIOD at all in regards to checked out games and your service is immediately canceled at the point of cancellation, unable to be used past that point and any checked out games are considered past due. Bullshit. Would never do business with Gamefly based on that experience.

        Oh, wait, LOL, never mind. I just didn't read far enough down the help page. LOL. They just designed the page weird and the tab isn't tabby. Just a heading that I glossed over.
      </div><div>
        <b>back to the future / saturday night fever:</b> I'm watching Back To The Future and maybe, the scene where Biff kicks Marty out of the car and gets a little rapey with his Mom didn't happen in the original timeline, but I don't know. It just put things in a weird perspective from the beginning of the movie. Also, that weird rape scene in Saturday Night Fever was so incredibly offputting. It made me really appreciate the progress we've had in society that that scene it's kind of just glossed over, she's being gangraped in the back of a car with little to no moral outrage by the characters. Idk, maybe it was as bad for that generation of audience and this is just an overly weird post.
      </div><div>
        <b>fantasia: </b>I remember being really, really little and watching Fantasia. I was bored out of my mind. What I couldn't figure out though was why it was in theaters? I read through the Wikipedia and I remember being mystified as to when it could have been released. Though, I read it <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fantasia_(1940_film)#1969%E2%80%931990_runs'>now</a> and I realize the way it was written, I maybe just missed te part about it being released in 1990. Every other time period, I would have been too young, but 1990 was about right. Though, even then, 1990 seems a bit late, but in hindsight, it makes sense. Why though was it that I had to read in a Disney Adventures from 1990 about the release to finally realize that was when I saw it?

        <b>kawaiisu:</b> The last male fluent speaker of this language died in 2022. I know he had a sister that possibly spoke the language but I don't know if she's still alive.
      </div><div>
        <b>Good Will Hunting: </b>If someone would have asked me, when did this movie come out? I'd have said 1994. Complete confidence. Bet a $100. The fact it was 1997 is crazy to me. 
      </div><div>
        <b>Deebo:</b>Anyone that's watched Friday knows who Deebo is but I didn't know that character was in Next Friday. I cannot for the life of me remember him in that movie though. If I'm remembering correctly, I think it was something to do with the Mexicans next door.
      </div><div>
        Ohhhh. I read the Wikipedia entry and now I remember. I remember that scene where Deebo and that one guy have to sneak into that animal control car and he keeps yelling at the other guy.
      </div><div>
        <b>Ultima 7: </b>So I know I was playing Ultima Online in 1997. I must have gotten it for Christmas because I remembered that Catskills had just opened. But more importantly, I remember playing Ultima 7 -obsessively- It was one of the greatest games to have ever existed. It had systemic behavior that was unseen in so many games. And what's even crazier is it was released in 1992!!!! I was playing that game for YEARS so the idea that I was still playing a game released in 1992 as fresh as it was first released is crazy to me.
      </div><div>
        <b>Highlander TV series:</b> I tried rewatching the old show but I became slightly enraged (and this is kind of weirdo behavior on my part) about a particular scene. So it's a scene with Joe Pantoliano. (He's been in lots of stuff, but was in Sopranos & How To Make It In America) where he's a doctor or something like that and calling a nurse for some kind of update. And it's so clearly that both actors filmed their scenes separately without talking to each other, because he's doing it with personality and charm and the nurse is doing it very matter of factly. (not responding at all to his charm) Now there's the possibility that actress he was working with just didn't reply appropriately in the moment but occam's razor says they just filmed the scenes separately because the difference is just so jarring.
      </div><div>
        <b>hip hop: </b> I cannot tell you how much I hate conscious rap. Not so much the injection of positivity in contrast to negative street stuff. That's fine. That's cool. But, like, the moralizing, when it's all just a facade for some religious context that I do not agree with any context.
      </div><div>
        I thought this just some random underground rapper, but apparently, it was an -early- track from before the Fugees were The Fugees when they were still called The Translataz Crew or whatever. Their debut album was in 1994 but this track was on a radio program from the end of 1993 and Lauryn isn't even on it. The song is Living Like There Ain't No Tomorrow.

        <b>neurodivergence/'too quiet': </b>I was just thinking back to an outting I had with a girl. It wasn't really a date. It was just me driving her (just her and I) to some place that a bunch of people were going to. Like a getting to know me type of thing. When we got there, I talked to my friend and he told me she said she wasn't interested because I was 'too quiet'. That was the weirdest criticism for me, because I was talking non-stop the entire drive there, asking her questions about herself and her giving these uninterested answers. And it made me wonder if being 'too quiet' is really just code for neurodivergence. I mean, obviously, she could have thought I was ugly or whatever and that was the nice way of putting it but it genuinely feels like it was code for something else. Like me not being aggressive enough or projecting some kind of persona like neurotypicals do. 
      </div><div>
        I was thinking about secondhand from that same friend, the friend that told me what she said, was rejected by another girl on the same premise and I just think that's such a weird criteria. "Too quiet" idk, just seems weird to me.
      </div><div>
        <b>The Watchers: </b> I watched The Watchers yesterday and one anachronism really, really bothered me. Maybe it's a type of computer I am not familiar with but at one point during the computer, there's this really old looking computer from the 80s. It even has the prototypical Apple II load in screen but then: it plays video! And not some weird ass fucking cut-scene 1991-style video, regular ass video. That really, really bothered me. Ohhhhhh, and this was in 2008??? By 2008, unless my memory has completely failed me, we were mostly where we are at now in terms of desktops and their general feel and look. Having a 1980s desktop in 2008 just seems weird af. hmm, I wonder if they were doing some kind of desktop theme though. Like, the character they were depicting was an old guy so maybe he would feel more comfortable with a 1980s style interface, but even then that just seems weird af because those themes aren't that all encompassing. But -maybe-

        <b>The Room(2019): </b>What kind of monster demands their wife have a baby when she's clearly traumatized by the past two stillbirths she had?
      </div><div>
        <b>golden corral:</b> I watch AMC Plus a lot lately because it's my streaming service for the month but there's a Golden Corral commercial on there. It's a family eating with two girls and this little girl, the first thing she says is, 'When I grow up...' and with how quickly she says and it being the first she says, I swear it sounds like 'negra' and it's always really jarring. I think it's just a weird effect after seeing it over and over again.

        <b>persepolis rising:</b> I've just started reading. And I'm going to make a prediction that Clarissa will use her implants to sacrifice herself in the end. I hope I'm wrong though.
      </div><div>
        Another prediction: Miller is coming back. Maybe that's obvious given how central he was for a few books though. (p210)
      </div><div>
        Another prediction and I'm almost at the end, the Laution or whatever they are will be defeated like Marcus Inaro did. At least one of the ships anyways. (I'm also wondering if Naomi's son ever comes back into the story? And that's kinda sad if she doesn't.)
      </div><div>
        SPOILER: I'm said that I was right on one of the predictions and I think I know how the next one will work out. Last minute reveal before the story ends.
      </div><div>
        <b>tisha campbell: </b> I just read something on Twitter that compared Topanga from Boy Meets World (I think her real name Danielle Fischell?) and Tisha Campbell and how they look similar. And another person said that because Topanga is white, she's always been viewed as beautiful but because Tisha is black she's just seen as mid. WWWWWWHHHHHHHHAAATTTTTT!???!!? That's crazy. Like, out of your mind insane crazy. Anyone who thinks that either was never around in the 80s or didn't see her in House Party. She's always been and will always be THAT GIRL! And anything to the contrary is pure slander. 
      </div><div>
        On a side note, I don't know who I am confusing her with but I totally thought her name was tischa campbell. Unless I'm thinking of her frequent collaborator Tichina Arnold? 
      </div><div>
   
        <b>stater bros:</b>
        it's really dumb that if you go to the stater bros website to search for stuff, it searches the website without searching the prdoucts and you have to shop now to access the products.
      <div>
        <b>video games: </b> I really appreciate when games let you turn off music entirely without having to manually set the volume to 0.
      </div><div>

        <b>Blackberry movie:</b> The weird thing about being old and living through time periods depicted in media is seeing the weird anachronisms that are depicted. In 2003, I can imagine that someone was still listening to a cassette tape but not a walkman.  I was listening to tapes in 2008 or 2009 but only because my car had a tape player and I didn't have money to replace it or buy a tape adapter. The idea that a techie would still be listening to tapes seems pretty unlikely.  (I just realized this character is wearing an 80s handband in 2008, so maybe it's not so crazy.)
      </div><div>
        <b>T-Mobile Sidekick:</b> Watching this movie reminded me of that brief period of time when the Sidekick was so awesome. I remember seeing Paris Hilton use it and thought it was so cool. Blackberry was for business professionals and was probably out of my league. I got the Sidekick 3. I was a little disappointed though. It didn't have the smartphone functionality that I dreamed of. At that point, we were still in the nascent phones-aren't-quite-computers-yet stage. It was cool af to type on that though. I remember just literally sitting in a courtyard texting random people, just because I could.
      </div><div>
        <b>res dogs: </b> that dude from Incubus (brandon whatever), I remember how that guy was a huge star back when Incubus was big, big.
      </div><div>
        <b>cryptonomicon: </b> there's a scene in this novel where the main character is accused of being a technocrat and he bristles at the term and goes in to a long tirade against it. This is so clearly coming from the author's point of view it's not even funny.
      </div><div>
        <b>American Me: </b> In the beginning of the movie, it's 1959 and the character is 16. He has a younger brother who's a toddler then cut to that toddler being ten years later. It's crazy that a 45 year old Edward James Olmos was supposedly a 26 year old during one part of the movie. Doesn't make any sense.
      </div><div>
        <b>American Me: </b> Years ago, there was a local radio station that had a segment or hosts or something that was called Pocos Pero Locos. I thought it was Pocos Perros Locos (little crazy dogs) and thought it was kind of an odd title but after hearing it in American Me, it makes more sense why they would name it that.
      </div><div>
        <b> For All Mankind: </b> season 4. Just saw Tania Raymonde on there. I was so excited to see her!! I hadn't seen her since Lost and I've been fan since Malcolm in the Middle.
