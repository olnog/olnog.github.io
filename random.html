        <b>The Twelve: </b> I really enjoyed The Passage. The premise wasn't that interesting to me and it was the last book of my batch from the library. There were a few others that I had started and abandoned, but I don't think I'm liking this next one. I knew ahead of time that they weren't continuing where The Passage left off, but, yeah, it kinda sucks so far. The Passage was just interesting to keep me reading until the post-apocalypse hits then I was riveted. Now I'm just hoping to find something compelling...and almost none of it is.

        <b>golden corral:</b> I watch AMC Plus a lot lately because it's my streaming service for the month but there's a Golden Corral commercial on there. It's a family eating with two girls and this little girl, the first thing she says is, 'When I grow up...' and with how quickly she says and it being the first she says, I swear it sounds like 'negra' and it's always really jarring. I think it's just a weird effect after seeing it over and over again.

        <b>persepolis rising:</b> I've just started reading. And I'm going to make a prediction that Clarissa will use her implants to sacrifice herself in the end. I hope I'm wrong though.
      </div><div>
        Another prediction: Miller is coming back. Maybe that's obvious given how central he was for a few books though. (p210)
      </div><div>
        Another prediction and I'm almost at the end, the Laution or whatever they are will be defeated like Marcus Inaro did. At least one of the ships anyways. (I'm also wondering if Naomi's son ever comes back into the story? And that's kinda sad if she doesn't.)
      </div><div>
        SPOILER: I'm said that I was right on one of the predictions and I think I know how the next one will work out. Last minute reveal before the story ends.
      </div><div>
        <b>tisha campbell: </b> I just read something on Twitter that compared Topanga from Boy Meets World (I think her real name Danielle Fischell?) and Tisha Campbell and how they look similar. And another person said that because Topanga is white, she's always been viewed as beautiful but because Tisha is black she's just seen as mid. WWWWWWHHHHHHHHAAATTTTTT!???!!? That's crazy. Like, out of your mind insane crazy. Anyone who thinks that either was never around in the 80s or didn't see her in House Party. She's always been and will always be THAT GIRL! And anything to the contrary is pure slander. 
      </div><div>
        On a side note, I don't know who I am confusing her with but I totally thought her name was tischa campbell. Unless I'm thinking of her frequent collaborator Tichina Arnold?

        <b>stater bros:</b>
        it's really dumb that if you go to the stater bros website to search for stuff, it searches the website without searching the prdoucts and you have to shop now to access the products.
      <div>
        <b>video games: </b> I really appreciate when games let you turn off music entirely without having to manually set the volume to 0.

        <b>Blackberry movie:</b> The weird thing about being old and living through time periods depicted in media is seeing the weird anachronisms that are depicted. In 2003, I can imagine that someone was still listening to a cassette tape but not a walkman.  I was listening to tapes in 2008 or 2009 but only because my car had a tape player and I didn't have money to replace it or buy a tape adapter. The idea that a techie would still be listening to tapes seems pretty unlikely.  (I just realized this character is wearing an 80s handband in 2008, so maybe it's not so crazy.)

        <b>T-Mobile Sidekick:</b> Watching this movie reminded me of that brief period of time when the Sidekick was so awesome. I remember seeing Paris Hilton use it and thought it was so cool. Blackberry was for business professionals and was probably out of my league. I got the Sidekick 3. I was a little disappointed though. It didn't have the smartphone functionality that I dreamed of. At that point, we were still in the nascent phones-aren't-quite-computers-yet stage. It was cool af to type on that though. I remember just literally sitting in a courtyard texting random people, just because I could.

        <b>res dogs: </b> that dude from Incubus (brandon whatever), I remember how that guy was a huge star back when Incubus was big, big.
      </div><div>
        <b>cryptonomicon: </b> there's a scene in this novel where the main character is accused of being a technocrat and he bristles at the term and goes in to a long tirade against it. This is so clearly coming from the author's point of view it's not even funny.
      </div><div>
        <b>American Me: </b> In the beginning of the movie, it's 1959 and the character is 16. He has a younger brother who's a toddler then cut to that toddler being ten years later. It's crazy that a 45 year old Edward James Olmos was supposedly a 26 year old during one part of the movie. Doesn't make any sense.
      </div><div>
        <b>American Me: </b> Years ago, there was a local radio station that had a segment or hosts or something that was called Pocos Pero Locos. I thought it was Pocos Perros Locos (little crazy dogs) and thought it was kind of an odd title but after hearing it in American Me, it makes more sense why they would name it that.

        <b> For All Mankind: </b> season 4. Just saw Tania Raymonde on there. I was so excited to see her!! I hadn't seen her since Lost and I've been fan since Malcolm in the Middle.
